&lt;p&gt;The Forest Resources of this planet has been depleting at a very fast rate due to ever growing demand of wood and wood based products especially from the developed countries. And, in the process the entire ecological equilibrium has been disturbed leading to vanishing of flora and fauna, and the like. Despite the best efforts from the world community, the demand of the wood based products is simply not declining but is on the rise leading to illegal felling of trees, smuggling of wood, etc. This is presently leading to a disaster in the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been focus on alternatives to wood and a lot of composites including plastics have come up but all these have their own restrictions in usability towards complete replacement of wood. However, of late bamboo has been gaining focus as a viable replacement of wood to some extent because of its quick regeneration i.e. within four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as our country is concerned, the statistics of the year 2000 shows that in that year our total wood consumption was 60 million cu. m. Of this, 20 million cu. m. were imported worth at least Rs. 10,000 crore. To meet the demand Government has put wood import under OG L. The demand of wood in our country is rising at 10 per cent per annum. Most of the wood requirement of the country is converted into Plywood and in sawn timber for construction and agriculture articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wood Industry in the North Eastern Region&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the North Eastern Region, due to availability of prime quality timbers, wood-based industry had an early entry and healthy growth in this part of the country. Manufacturing activities of plywood started in this region as early as 1916. Although the industry suffered a setback initially, it started flourishing after World War II and became a promising industry. About 70 factories were set up in the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya which produced about 60 per cent of national production of plywood in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These plywood industries were based on timber from natural forests. Continued extraction of logs from forest without adequate attention of regeneration led to considerable depletion of the forest wealth. Looking into the seriousness of the situation, Honourable Supreme Court put ban on felling of timber in forests. This led to closure of plywood industries in North East India in December 1996. Since then a huge infrastructure in the form of plywood manufacturing machinery and equipment has remained idle leaving thousands of skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workers unemployed. Considering the low level of industrialisation in the State, most of these workers were either unemployed or adopted petty means of earning their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present context, even if a plywood mill is valued at Rs. 4 crore, a total of assets worth Rs. 300 crore is lying idle or undergoing the process of natural decay. Replacement value at present cost will be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revival of the closed Plywood Units in the region using Bamboo as the raw material&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has been mentioned earlier, bamboo has been rediscovered. Bamboo timber has good physical and mechanical properties. Its tensile, compressive and static strength and modules of elasticity are far more than common coniferous wood and also has good elasticity, tenacity and wear ability. Bamboo can also be converted to more value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;added form like bamboo plywood. Bamboo plywood is a board based on bamboo timber produced through a series of mechanical and chemical process and pressed together under certain temperature and pressure by adhesive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use bamboo for majority of applications of wood, particularly in larger volumes like paper, plywood, construction and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology for making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo Mat Boards (BMB), Bamboo Mat Corrugated Sheets (B M CS), Bamboo and Wood Composites (BWC), etc. have been developed in the country by IPIRTI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machinery and equipment needed to make BMB, BMCS,  etc. are similar to those of Plywood industries except that some small machineries and equipment are to be added and may be some minor modifications are required in the existing machineries of those plywood industries like in the hot press as the specific pressure required for bamboo is more than that of plywood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the above circumstances, it may be possible to revive the closed plywood units in the region using bamboo as the main raw material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Resources in the region&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India total bamboo growing area is estimated to be 9 million hectares with a growing stock of around 90 million tonnes. Bamboo is found in all states of the country naturally, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;but the North Eastern region of the country is rich in bamboo resources both in variety and extent. The region accounts for more than 60 per cent of the total growing stock of bamboo in the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North East India is recognised as one of the largest reserve of bamboo and cane. Tewari (1992) reported that more than 50 percent of the total bamboo species present in India are available in the region. About 89 species of bamboos out of 129 in India under 16 genera takes shelter in different forest types of this region. Both natural, which are present in the forests as well as those cultivated bamboo are well distributed in tropical and sub-tropical region. Some species of bamboo are found in the temperate and sub-alpine forests. The major genera include Arundinaria, Bambusa, Chimonobambusa, Melocanna, Ochlandra (Exotic), Oxytenanthera, Phyllostachys, Pleioblastus, Pseudossa (Exotic), Schizostachyum, Semiarundinaria, Sinobambusa, Thamnocalamus, Thyrsostachys, etc. Among these genera,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizostachyum, Bambusa and Dendrocalamus are important because they have large number of species. The genus Schizostachyum has 27 species followed by Bambusa which accounts for 21 species, 13 species are under the genus Dendrocalamus. The genus Bambusa is one of the most important genuses in terms of usefulness and species diversity. Genera&#039; like Melocanna, Phyllostachys, Gigantochloa, Chimonobambusa though are with limited number of species are grater in importance in terms of utilisation. In terms of geographical coverage Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Bambusa pallida, Melocanna baccifera, Phyllostachys bambusoides, Arundinaria sp., Chimonobambusa callosa, Schizostachyum polymorphum, S. capitatum are prominent with wider distribution and coverage in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revival of closed Plywood Mills of the region -why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revival of closed plywood mills if revived using bamboo as the main raw material would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save quite a substantial amount of fresh investment and time compared to setting up of new units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise utilisation of the existing land, sheds, machinery and equipment which will otherwise be a colossal loss to the nation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate hundreds of thousands of employment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate bamboo based boards market in the country as a viable replacement of wood. The existing channels of marketing of these plywood industries could be utilised for marketing of bamboo boards thereby making way for other bamboo based units market to be set up &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;elsewhere in the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute substantially to the States&#039; GDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the forests in the near future and help maintaining the fragile ecological balance of this region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boost build up of confidence amongst other investors for investing in this region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be in tandem with the objectives of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;&quot;National Mission on Bamboo Technology and Trade Development.&quot; Moreover, this National Mission intends to plant bamboo on commercial basis throughout the country in an area of two million hectares in five years&#039; time. Of this, about 0.3 million hectares will be planted in the region both in forest as well as in the non-forest land. Till such time of harvest of these plantations, present stock of bamboo which is in sufficient quantity can be utilised by the revived units.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help utilisation of the flowered bamboo, i.e. Melocanna baccifera to generate more value added products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate awareness about bamboo uses and encourage farmers to plant bamboo as a means of income generation and also set up village level clusters and ancillary units and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plywood industry in India has the history of more than 100 years. First, it started to clear the needs of tea industry by providing them tea-chest panels. Then in the 30s it started coming up with products for commercial use. Preliminarily it got its footing in southern and western India and then in West Bengal but due to many environmental restrictions on felling trees it shrunk to Northeast part of India and for a few decades Northeast dominated in the manufacture of plywood. Again with easing of imports of timber many veneer and plywood industries grew in large numbers in various parts of India and later on with the entry of plantation timber, it mushroomed in northern part of India and in the State of Kerala based on rubber wood. Northeast which dominated plywood industry has come to almost a standstill for last few years more precisely after 1996 due to imposition of ban on logging by the Honourable Supreme Court of India. Most of the units closed down since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of great agony that in spite of huge quantity of timber being available in Myanmar at a distance of 5C km from these units in the northeast India, they are noti travelling all the way to southern Myanmar and through Yangoon sometimes to various parts of India. Althougl-sufficient infrastructure exists in Northeast with skillet manpower and full local support, if the missing link coulc be connected by road network between India and Myanmat and if both the Governments take some positive steps it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;removing the bureaucratic hurdles, both the countries would benefit immensely by way of improvement of logistics. Gurjan wood, which is available in abundance in Myanmar, has wide acceptability in India, whereas in other parts of the world it is least preferred due to inherent resin content in this specie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a proper roadway is established, the veneer units located in the Northeast would be able to import Gurjan timber from Myanmar and would be able to supply veneer, which is produced from Gurjan timber to various parts of India and the remaining core veneer could be utilised to produce plywood in the region — this is the way to revive plywood industries in the region which are on the verge of death. Presently the turnover of the timber supplied from northern part of Myanmar and for the timber available elsewhere in Myanmar, we have a group of entrepreneurs in India, who would love to establish their units in southern part of Myanmar. Indian entrepreneurs are more attracted due to cultural parity and traditional bondage between the two countries — India and Myanmar, and over and above all these, due to the proximity and improving relations between the countries at a very fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above, there could be joint working plans and forest utilisation could be monitored on the basis of &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;sustainable yield by both the countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the road links are re-established and proper monitoring mechanism is in place, there could be exploitation of the vast opportunities existing in the development of trade and commerce between the two countries much beyond timber only, which includes development of tourism, huge potential for cooperation in areas like energy, cement, natural gas, food processing and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market size for Bamboo Plyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total market size of all different types of boards and plywood put together is estimated at Rs. 5,000 crore currently out of which plywood industry is Rs. 4,000 crore and that of the other boards (MDF, Particle, Hard board) is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rs. 1,000 crore. The cost economics of using bamboo filling as against wood provides ample justification for this kind of switchover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current cost of soft wood used as core in plywood is Rs. 6,300 per cubic metre with a density of 0.65. The cost of bamboo mats made out of slivers is Rs. 2.25 per sq ft with a weight of 250 gm which is Rs. 3,125 per cubic metre. (This is inclusive of the transportation cost of Rs. 1,000 per metric tonne by rail). In case the industry in the N ER would use the material it would cost Rs. 2,750 per cubic metre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the same thickness, the normal plywood is 2.29 times costlier than bamboo board. The plywood can be priced at &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Rs. 25 — Rs. 30 per sq ft for a 12 mm thickness board at the market level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switchover to bamboo based ply board can take place in at least 20 per cent of the organised medium sized units currently engaged in plywood production and which have been shut down because of non availability of material. This implies a total market size of Rs. 200 crore which can be expected in the next four years which is the current turnover of the organised medium sector plywood units. The units belonging to the unorganised sector can also be expected to switchover because of the cost economics involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present turnover of the unorganised sector is Rs. 3,000 crore out of which even if ten per cent of the units switchover to bamboo it implies a turnover of Rs. 300 crore for the bamboo board industry. A total turnover of Rs. 500 crore can be expected from the plywood industry alone. The ply board, which is manufactured using bamboo mats and slivers, can be used for applications like shuttering, railway slippers, truck bodybuilding, packaging and furniture making. Primary interviews were conducted with these user industries to ascertain their inclination to use the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Present Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the growing awareness about bamboo, the Government of India has embarked upon a national programme called the National Mission on Bamboo Technology and Trade Development. The detailed project report for this Mission has been prepared and the same after consideration by the Ministry of Agriculture has now been sent to the Planning Commission for their concurrence. At the same time, there is a National Mission on Bamboo applications under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, which is attending to technological aspects of bamboo development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre located at Guwahati is the nodal organisation for all bamboo related activities in the North Eastern region of India. Since the past four years, it has been rendering yeomen&#039;s service to the cause of bamboo and making it a popular household name. Spurred by these efforts, the North Eastern Council has formulated the North East Bamboo Mission and the task of implementing the same has been entrusted to the Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre, Guwahati.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Seminar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to address all these issues, the Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre, Guwahati organised a day long seminar at Guwahati on August 27, 2004. The meet was attended by officials of the Planning Commission, North Eastern Council, Forest Departments of the various States, Industries &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Departments of the various States, Members of the Federation of Indian Plywood &amp;amp; Penal Industries (FIPPI), Indian Plywood Industries Research and Training Institute (IPIRTI) and others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seminar started with an inaugural function in which His Excellency Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Ajai Singh, the Governor of Assam and the Chairman of the North Eastern Council lit the traditional lamp and inaugurated the Seminar. The Governor in his address stated that &quot;the people of the North¬east should take up cultivation of bamboo as a serious enterprise. Market forces must determine the demand for the supply of bamboo in the region.&quot; The inaugural meet was also attended by Dr. Kama&#039; Taori, Secretary, North Eastern Council who laid great emphasis on the need to utilise the bamboo resources of the region. Dr. R. Mandal, Adviser, Planning Commission of India, in his introductory observation stated that &quot;I won&#039;t call bamboo a substitute for wood as it degrades the value of bamboo, the great green treasure. After the Supreme Court imposed a ban on felling of trees in the north eastern States, almost all the plywood production units in the region have had to close down leading to large scale unemployment.&quot; Dr. Mandal stated that bamboo is much better than teak in terms of fire resistance power and water absorption efficiency; what is more, it is also termite proof. Earlier all the invited guests were felicitated and Mr. Kamesh Salam, Director, Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre, Guwahati, welcomed the participants and delivered the theme address. Mr. Salam also outlined the rationale behind the holding of the Seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two technical sessions that followed the inaugural function, a number of presentations were made by various experts including Dr. Mandal, IPIRTI, FIPPI, banks and the like. Upon completion of the presentations, there was a session to discuss the various issues from all quarters. After a careful deliberation, the Chairman proposed to constitute a task force to make an in depth study and arrive at a logical revival package to facilitate reopening of the closed and shut down units using bamboo as the main raw material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the discussions at the Seminar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There should be a study on the data gathered by the Forest Working Plan and that of the Forest Survey of India and collate them in order to arrive at the actual growing stock of bamboo in each division which in turn will help designing the revival of the closed mills. This study may also include the royalty rate notified by the forest department in each state to asses the real market value of bamboo. This will help in fixing the price of mats etc. Also, the inter-state movement of N ER should be free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The closed mills will also have the option to produce composites of bamboo and wood. The inner fillings may be that of bamboo and the outer of wood veneer. The usage of bamboo in such composites will be more than 80 per cent. For this, opening of a Land Customs Station to import timber from Myanmar, etc. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;at Pangsau will immensely help the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;mills situated in Assam and Arunachal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Pradesh. Presently, H PC has put &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;restrictions on import of timber in NER. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;In order to avoid any complication in the future, the NEC should get a clarification from MOEF whether the three committees (H PC, SIT and C EC) constituted by the Honourable Supreme Court would have any say over the units which have converted from plywood &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;units based on wood to plywood made from bamboo mats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to closure of these plywood mills, most of them enjoyed the health code &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;A-1 account in the banks for a number &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;of years. The High Power Committee (H PC), a committee constituted by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Honourable Supreme Court, in its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;report had also stated that timber is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;deteriorating fast and immediate action to dispose off the same be taken up. In the order dated 15.01.1998 of the Honourable Supreme Court the MOEF had stated that 1.2 lac cubic metre of timber is getting deteriorated. The banks&#039; finance was given against stock of timber and chemicals. Even though the stocks were legal, as certified by the H PC, had to be written off as it had deteriorated. Thus the value of the stock of timber, which was felled in 1996, lost all its commercial value by the time it was allowed to be consumed in 2002. The Honourable Supreme Court also directed that salary and wages be paid to all the workers and staff and none of them could be retrenched or dismissed. The companies had to incur all expenses without income, thus after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;paying interest for a certain period they could not pay the same as all their resources were wiped out. Thus the account with the banks became N PA without any fault of the Management. This fact was also acknowledged by the RBI in its IECD. No.13/08.12.01/2001-02 dated November 22, 2001. In the said Circular w r to all the banks, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;it stated &quot;It has come to our notice that to certain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;extraneous circumstances, the operation of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;wood and panel based industry in the North Eastern Region has been adversely affected, resulting in closure of a number of units during the last four years. Considering the importance of this industry in the North Eastern Region and with a view to enabling the industry to regain its financial health, it has been decided that banks may &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;extend financial assistance, by way of a rehabilitation package.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the light of these issues, the following action points are recommended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;i) A financial package may be designed for their &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;revival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;ii) The new Industrial Policy for the North Eastern Region announced by the Government of India be &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;plywood amended to enable the closed plywood mills to enjoy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;all the benefits asked for in the Industrial Policy as notified by the Government of India, vide their N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;otification No. Dated provided they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;revive using bamboo as the main raw material in line with the objectives of the National Bamboo Mission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;iii) Measures for prevention of abuse/ misuse of the proposed facility/ benefit be suggested by the task force proposed by this Seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;iv) The facility should also include exemption of Import Duty for new equipment required for switching over to bamboo based industry, provided those items of equipment/ tools are included in the exempted list of the Ministry of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. It was also decided during the discussion that the CBTC may enter into an agreement with one or two units having sound management, necessary equipment and are willing to utilise bamboo as raw material. So that the experience gained from these units could be passed on to the other closed units. These units could become commercial R&amp;amp;D projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. That a Task Force be constituted with the following persons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. P.L. Thanga IAS (Planning Adviser, NEC) Chairman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kamesh Salam (Director CBTC) Member Secretary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative of TIM PACK Industries Pvt. Limited Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative of SBI Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative of FIN E R Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. M.M. Jalan, Representative of FIPPI Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative of MoEF Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative of Forest Department, Govt. of Assam Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. H.S.Das, Finance Commissioner, Govt. of Assam Member&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. M.P. Agarwal, Kaziranga Wood Products P. Ltd., G uwahati&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Member&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative from Nagaland Member &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;rhe Task Force will conduct an in depth study on the ollowing aspects related to the plywood industries of the &#039;eg i on:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Probable products that could be manufactured using bamboo alone and with bamboo and wood composites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Source of raw material; setting up of village based clusters,  etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Need for renovation of the existing machineries e.g. hot press, etc. for utilising bamboo as the pressure need is higher (specific pressure is from 17 kg/ sq m to 20 kg/ sq m or more) and cost involvement in such up gradation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Purchase of additional machineries and their cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The existing liabilities be settled and amount be fixed which be paid in ten years bearing soft interest. The FIs/ banks will have the charge on existing fixed assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Legal implications for using bamboo freely to be made available both from the forest as well as non-forest areas and necessary institutional interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Policy issues like listing bamboo in the scheduled list of 18 industries under Notification Nol. 33/99 in the new industrial policy for the North Eastern Region announced by the Central Government—the possibility of declaring the revived plywood units using bamboo as the principal raw material as new industrial units under the above policy to avail of the entire fiscal and other benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Conducting a study of the Plywood cluster model in Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, where the Plywood and Plywood Industry have come up in large scale and again which is linked up to the plantation of fast growing timber species such as poplars, eucalyptus, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Any other relevant points for consideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon completion of the study, the Task Force will prepare a report in the form of an &#039;Attractive Revival Package&#039; indicating clearly the roles to be played by the Government of India, the respective State Governments, the NEC and the entrepreneurs/ industrialists. Any financial involvement from the Government of India, the respective State Governments, etc. will have to be mentioned clearly with sufficient justification and the clear-cut benefits to be accrued upon revival of some of the units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. M.M. Jalan, Managing Director, Arunachal Plywood Industry, Arunachal Pradesh and Mr. Kamesh Salam, Director, Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre, Guwahati signed the package of revival plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tripura - The Land of Eternal Charm</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/tripura-land-eternal-charm</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The erstwhile princely State of Tripura, once known as H ill Tippera, is located in the extreme southwest corner of the North Eastern region of India. This ancient land of mysterious past is bounded on the north, west, and southeast by Bangladesh and in the east by Assam and Mizoram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue of Cane &amp;amp; Bamboo News is dedicated to the State of Tripura. We will not only take you on a short voyage of discovery of this land of age old culture and tradition, replete with exquisite colours and excellent craftsmanship but also give you a glimpse on the role bamboo plays in the life of Tripura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topography: Tripura is a small state with an area of around 10,500 sq kms. The land is predominantly flat with an average altitude of about 13 metres above mean sea level. From east to the west it slopes into the vast plains of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate&lt;/strong&gt;: This land receives an average rainfall of about 2,100 mm per year. The temperature is hot and humid in summer ranging between 25° to 36° Celsius while the winters are pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flora &amp;amp; Fauna: About two thirds of the land area of Tripura is under forest cover where different species of trees, orchids, birds and wild life abound. The vegetation is by and large tropical. The bamboo grows in abundance and Tripura is the largest producer of rattan (cane) in the country. There are four wild life sanctuaries in the State, namely the Rowa, Sepahijala, Trishna and Gomti. The vast colony of resident and migratory birds of about 150 species make Sepahijala Wild Life Sanctuary, in the vicinity of Agartala, a lively and popular attraction for birdwatchers. The crab eating mongoose, last sighted some 72 years ago in India, has been rediscovered here. The spectacled monkey is another attraction. Sepahijala is ideally located to soak in those spectacular views of the coffee and rubber plantations. The Indian bisons (Gaur), elephants, deer and primates are the attractions in the sanctuaries of Tripura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/strong&gt;: Tripura has a population of about 31.91 lakh, of which about 31 percent belong to the tribal communities while the remaining are mainly Bengalees. Over the last few centuries since the time of Tripura&#039;s royal dynasty, both tribals and non-tribals of Hindu, Muslim, Christian and Buddhist faith have been living in the State in peace and harmony. According to the Rajmala, the history chronicle of the Royal dynasty, from about the 15th century the Bengalees have peacefully lived with the original tribal inhabitants of Tripura. The Bengalee population is concentrated in the plains while most of the tribal communities who are ethnically of Indo-Mongoloid stock live in the hill areas. There are nineteen major tribes each with distinctive characteristics of language, religion and social customs. Tripuris form the biggest tribe of the State comprising about 60 percent of the total tribal population. They belong to ;the Bodo group of Indo-Mongoloid origin and are one of the Kokborok linguistic groups. Some among the other major tribes are Reang, Chakma, Jamatia and Noatia. The tribes worship several deities but traits of animism dominate their religious practices. The tribal pujas and festivals are connected with the worship of nature in its various manifestations and are celebrated with ritualistic gaiety. The Kharchi puja is one of the most popular festivals of Tripura transcending boundaries of place and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal sacrifice is a common phenomenon in most forms of worship. The other important festivals of Tripura are the Garia puja, Durga puja, Diwali and Buddha Purnima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our deepest emotions find a natural expression in dance. The dances of the tribals of Tripura, in a superb blend of colour, music and rhythm, unfold their traditions and cultural heritage. The Hozagiri dance of the Reangs, also called the dance of balance, has brought for itself fame and widespread recognition. Performed by women during harvest, the subtle movements and gyrations of the body leave the onlookers spellbound. The Rabindra dance, named after Rabindranath Tagore, has been a popular dance among the Bengalees in Tripura. The long and intimate relationship of Tagore with Tripura has inspired the people of the land to take up dances along with Rabindra Sangeet. Already hundreds of Rabindra Sangeets have been translated into Kokborok language and they are being performed on the stage regularly. Interestingly, a number of Hindus who converted to Islam in the 12th and 13th century did not completely abandon their earlier rituals. One such practice they retained is the Biyer Gaan or Wedding Songs. Gradually it got absorbed in the Muslim society and into their culture. The Ras Leela performed by the Manipuri artistes of the State had mesmerised Rabindranath Tagore during one of his visits to Tripura. He took these dances to Santiniketan and incorporated aspects of Manipuri Dance form into Rabindra Dance. A fascinating culture has emerged out of the synthesis of Bengali and aboriginal cultures. It is common knowledge that the legendary music director, Sachin Dev Burman, belongs to Tripura. His repertory of film music compositions bore strong influences of the Sari and Dhamailfolk-tunes and traditions of Tripura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tripura is famed for its magnificent palaces, splendid rock cut carvings and stone images. The Ujjayanta Palace or the Royal Abode, built by the Manikya King, Maharaja Radhakishore, a little over a hundred years ago in Agartala is embellished with magnificent tiles and wooden ceilings and beautified by pools and gardens laid out in Mughal style. The Neermahal Palace built in the midst of the Rudrasagar Lake at the beginning of the last century is an aesthetic blend of the H indu-Muslim architecture. The Lake comes alive with birdsong during the annual arrival of the migratory birds. The Unakoti, meaning one less than a crore, is a Shaiva Pilgrimage built in stone and rock cut images during the 7.11 — 9th century AD. Legend has it that Lord Shiva on his way to Kashi with a crore of gods and goddesses stopped at Unakoti for the night. Before retiring for the night he asked them all to wake up before surprise to continue their journey. Finding he was the only one up at the prescribed time Lord Shiva left in a rage, turning his companions into stone images with a curse. There is thus one stone image less amongst the crore one can find at Unakoti. The Tripureswari temple which is one of the 51 pithas and the Bhubaneswari Temple are the other places of Hindu pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though small and sequestered in a tiny corner of the country, Tripura stands out unique as a place, almost religiously devoted to finest experiments in art and crafts made out of simple material like cane, bamboo, wood and palm leaf. Cane and bamboo occupy a distinctive place in the life of Tripura. From cradle to grave there is hardly any social ritual which can be complete without the use of cane and bamboo. The artisans of Tripura have perfected their artistic skills in crafting exquisite and captivating products out of cane and bamboo. These artisans have blended utility with aesthetic beauty in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economy: The economy is predominantly agrarian and the main crops are rice and potato. Fruits like orange and pineapple are grown and known for their succulence. The industrial base is weak because of its locational disadvantage. However, handicrafts, especially of cane and bamboo are an important source of livelihood for the people. Banking has spread over the State and there are 225 branches in all. Of these 93 are commercial bank branches while the rest are rural or co-operative branches. State Bank of India has 33 branches with a Regional Office in Agartala and the United Bank of India, which is the lead bank, has 41 branches. The aggregate deposits of all banks are about Rs. 2,500 crore while total lendings are nearly Rs. 750 crore. The geographical isolation, underdeveloped road and rail connectivity and festering insurgency are formidable challenges to socio economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bamboo and Tripura&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bamboo craft in Tripura can broadly be classified into constructed, loom-based, interlaced, and fine handicraft products. The loom-based products are a combination of textiles and bamboo. The study and documentation of the looms, materials and processes undertaken by the national Institute of Design is part of a larger project, in keeping with the greater view of developing handicrafts in a sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much a part of life, bamboo has created industries in every household where everyone from a child to an old grandparent is adept in this art. This craft has been in existence for ages but now Government and internationally funded projects are an effort to rekindle the spart of innovation and deep understanding of form and structure exhibited in the traditional bamboo and cane crafts of the region.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is so much a part of everyday life in Tripura that life without it cannot be imagined. Easy availability is one reason why this material is so widely used. Also, each part of the bamboo plant can be utilised for different purposes and products.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is prominent in its use as building material from flattened bamboo and for making products of daily use as storage or fishing instruments from split bamboo. The elaborate use of bamboo is an integral part of the culture.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some tribes, the umbilical cord of the babies is cut with a knife made of bamboo. Again the dead are laid to rest on bamboo beds. Thus it is seen that the whole life of a native starts and ends with bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It is also included as a food item, the shoots are eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culm is used as a container where the nodal wall forms the base of the hollow cylinder. Bamboo baskets are used to store rice, for fishing; fishing; rice beer is drunk in bamboo mugs; the fences are all woven out of bamboo; there are bridges made out of it and the people&#039;s houses are also made of bamboo. The Puran Tripuris live in Tong &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Houses or pile houses on hilltops. Poles support these bamboo huts, situated on a raised platform about five to six feet above the ground. This is a means to avoid wild animals. The houses seldom contained more than one room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their traditional garments are woven on traditional loin loom or bacl&amp;lt;strap loom, which is a very simple device made of a few bamboo stems. Bamboo is also used as a decorative item and associated with religious practices of the tribal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Garia Puja which is performed on the seventh day of Baishak (April) two deities, Kalia and Garia are worshipped. In this puja, the top end of a bamboo is bent in a particular manner to assume the image of the deity. The image is then framed into a bamboo barrel and enthroned on a platform. It is believed that the propitiation of the deity would make the people happy and prosperous. It is a community festival. There is dancing and rejoicing after the puja. During this festival there is sacrifice of cocks. This is popular among the Tripuris and the Reangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another community festival where four or five villages join together to celebrate the occasion. Here, people gather by the streamside, pare three pieces of bamboo into beautiful flowers, the villagers then build a temple with bamboo in the middle of the stream and the ageless rituals take place amidst joy and splendour. In this festival sacrifice of goats and buffaloes are done to save people from epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music also flows through bamboo. The melodious bamboo flute called the sumu baanshi accompanies the folk songs of Tripura. Folk songs depict a many sided picture of the people, its social, ritual and religious structure. The folk literature is very rich though it is only a dialect. The simple village people express their joys and sorrows, imagination and love through songs and tales. It is said that Tripuri mothers give instructions to their daughters and their sons-in-laws through songs. Moral lessons are imparted to the youth and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo and cane craft is a household industry in Tripura like weaving. The ancient rulers of Tripura were great patrons of this craft. The Rajas of the State patronised this craft by importing talented craftsmen from the neighbouring places. The abundance of raw materials from the rich forests within the State is also a contributory factor for the development of the craft. But according to publicised sources the industry suffered a setback with the downfall of royal patronage and the cane and bamboo crafts as it exists today in Agartala and its vicinity is of only recent origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emerging role of CBTC in Tripura&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CBTC is setting up two Bamboo Mat Processing Centres in Tripura, one at Kaifung in South Tripura District and the other at Dharmanagar in North Tripura District.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CBTC has drawn up plans for training of artisans from selected clusters. In some areas, the training has already started.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some selected areas, CBTC is providing the artisans with hand tools and implements.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CBTC will assist Tripura in establishing a Bamboo Cluster at Kil la Block of South Tripura.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CBTC is assisting the Government of Tripura in formulating a detailed project report on bamboo development in the State.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-april-2005&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B April 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Bamboo and Human Development</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/bamboo-and-human-development</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.necbdc.org.in/sites/default/files/article/Bamboo%20and%20Human.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; alt=&quot;Bamboo and Human Development&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of genus Bambusa or Bamboo is not only rich, but also warrants a promising future for humanity. It has benefited human societies since times immemorial, and continues to be a tremendous asset to billions of people around the world. Bamboo is a fast-growing widespread, renewable, versatile, low-or no-cost, environment-enhancing resource with the potential to improve life in the years to come, in both the rural and urban areas of the developed and developing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As global population grows and resources stretch, bamboo holds the potential to benefit the poor, with its vast spectrum of utilisation, ranging from providing shelter and piping to agricultural tools and furniture. Furthermore, apart from its traditional usage, bamboo has various new applications as an alternative to rapidly depleting wood resources, and as an option to more expensive materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper reviews the use of bamboo over time outlines the nature and properties of the plant and takes into consideration its particular importance for women. It then looks into some of the institutions working to promote greater use of bamboo, and the challenges this valuable resource faces to realise its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bamboo and people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the bamboo has been in use for at least 6000-7000 years, and has played an important economic and cultural role in the development of human societies especially in those regions of the world where it has been a dominant component of the vegetation. It has been variously described as the &#039;wood of the poor&#039; (India), the &#039;friend of the people&#039; (China), and the &#039;brother&#039; (Vietnam). Bamboo is an amazing plant that grows over wide areas of Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America. Today, millions of people continue to depend on the bamboo for food, fuel, housing, scaffolding, agricultural tools, cooking vessels, water jugs, arts and crafts, furniture, weapons, hunting gear, musical instruments, and the list goes on. Deeply entwined in cultures and heritage of people around the world, this versatile plant has come to symbolise strength, tenacity, endurance, and compromise. Bamboo seeds and protein-rich culms (shoots) are popular food item thr&#039;oughout Asia, and power a billion-dollar export industry in China, Taiwan-China, Japan and many Southeast Asian countries. The leaves and culms are often used in Asian baking and cooking, while bamboo is the food of choice of pandas, elephants and guinea pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicinal properties of bamboo have been well, known since ancient times and documented in the ancient Hindu system of medicine, Ayurveda (1500 B.C.), in Chinese scriptures and in Latin American literature. Various parts of bamboo leafs, rhizomes, roots and culms, as well as the charcoal made from its wood, have been used to treat a number of ailments such as cough, bile, fever, leprosy, swelling, cuts and wounds; it is also used as a laxative, bladder purifier and antidote for impotency and frigidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo has been, and continues to be widely used around the world to make spears, knives, arrows, blowguns, darts, fishing rods and harpoons. Some communities still rely on bamboo knives to sever the umbilical cord and to perform circumcision. In Thailand, bamboo knives are used to cut the thin gold paper that is used for offerings in Buddhist temples. Bamboo rafts have been commonly used for coastal commerce. The use of bamboo as a fuel source (capable of generating 4000-6000 cal/g) for households and small industries is an age-old, continuing practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since time immemorial, bamboo has played an important role in the development of percussion, wind, and string musical instruments; the flute being the most popular of them all. Flute-making is a specialised art catering to a multi-million dollar market, and produces designs from the simplest to the most sophisticated. References to the flute are found in the scriptures, myths, chronicles and legends of culture around the world. In the Hindu tradition, Lord Krishna, one of Vishnu&#039;s incarnations is depicted in all forms with a flute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo has also been a prime material for creating a wide array of household articles — baskets, utensils, lamps, furniture and art works. In China, bamboo weaving dates back to the Neolithic Age, and showed the highest sophistication and ingenuity as it evolved and broadened from producing articles of daily use to creating handicrafts and works of art for value-added commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing the linkage between bamboo and human development requires recognizing the leading role long played by China and to a lesser extent other Asian countries, such as Japan, India, Thailand and the Philippines. Asian history has cherished bamboo, heaping praise on its excellent attributes, and considered as integral to survival. It has been depicted. In poems, paintings, and music; and continues to form a vital element in the art of landscape gardening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of bamboo reached its pinnacle in China long before the Industrial Revolution in the West. The ancient Chinese classics were written on bamboo slates, and when the Chinese invented paper in the 9th century, it was made of bamboo. Even today, Chinese companies dominate the global bamboo trade with their fine quality crafts, a variety of industrial products, and works of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, theancient scripture, Rig Veda (1500 B.C.), often refers to the art of archery with bamboo as the favoured material for bows and arrows. In his famous Arthasastra (The Art of State Craft), Kautilya (322-298 B.C.), the prime minister to the first Maurya King refers to the lucrative bamboo trade as a major source of state revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Africa offers similar stories about the use of bamboo for fuel, construction and household items, although the recorded history is more recent. In both Latin America and Africa there has been little or no recognition of bamboo&#039;s socioeconomic potential for community development or national economies. However, largely through support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Timber Trade Organisation (ITTO), the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan. (INBAR), the last decade witnessed a renewed awareness of bamboo and a resurgence of its use, mostly for large-scale, low-cost housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West, the first mention of bamboo is found in a letter from Alexander the Great to Aristotle referred to by Pliny the Elder (23-79 A.D.) in his book on Natural History. The first high-tech application of bamboo in the West came in 1880, when Thomas Edison used a filament of bamboo carbon in his electric light bulb. At about the same time the Forest Research Institute in India pioneered industrial research for the commercial prdduction of paper from bamboo. This resulted in producing a variety of paper and pulp, including bleached and dissolved pulp for viscose and rayon and paved the way for development of the country&#039;s industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A giant, woody grass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is a product of the tropical forests — a tree like, woody grass, distantly related to wheat, with some 1250 species in 75 genera. It likely appeared 200 million years ago, during the Triassic Period, the era of the dinosaurs. Covering vast expanses of land (about 25 million hectares) it now grows in the tropical, subtropical and temperate zones of all regions of the world except Europe and western Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo&#039;s distribution ranges from 51°N (Sakhalin Island) to 47°S (Southern Argentina), and altitudes from near sea level to elevations of 4000m. South America and Southeast Asia are the centres of diversity. In Asia, bamboo is most abundant and diverse along the southern and south eastern borders. Africa has far fewer species (though Madagascar is rich with endemic genera); Australia has four indigenous species and the United States only one (prevalent across the country&#039;s southeast and mid west before European colonisation).Recent findings reveal that bamboo grew in Europe some three million years ago. It vanished during the last ice age, and was reintroduced about 200 years ago, mainly for horticultural purposes. A wide range of varieties and types have since been developed, with some tolerant to temperatures as low as -25°C.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bamboo culms live for up to 20-30 years. Some live for more than a century. The plant is a self-renewing resource, with fast-growing culms sprouting every year which more than replace those that have died or have been harvested. Although bamboo found in the natural forest is important for its quantity and diversity, the plant is grown in many parts of the world around villages and homesteads alongside food and other crops, owned or managed by local people. Large plantations have also been established by both the public and private sectors in Asia (over four million hectares in China), Latin America (Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, and Mexico), and even in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is the world&#039;s fastest and strongest growing woody plant. It grows approximately 7.5 to 40 cm a day, with the world record being 1.2 m in 24 hours in Japan. Bamboo grows three times faster than most species of eucalyptus and can be harvested four times as often. Commercially important species of bamboo usually mature in four or five years, after which time multiple harvests are possible every second year, for up to 120 years in some species, and indefinitely in others. Bamboo also excels in biomass production, giving 40 tonnes or more per hectare annually in managed stands. It accounts for around one-quarter of biomass produced in tropical regions and one-fifth of that produced in subtropical lands.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo&#039;s foliage shelters topsoil from the onslaught of tropical downpours, while its leaf litter (up to 10 cm a year) also cushions the soil from the impact of rain and eases the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;soil&#039;s absorption and retention of moisture. Bamboo preserves many exposed areas, providing micro-climates for forest regeneration and watershed protection (the plant&#039;s vast underground rhizome network may cover up to 100 square metres around one bamboo clump). It is often introduced to the banks of streams or in other vulnerable areas, for rapid control of soil erosion; one bamboo plant&#039;s closely matted roots can bind up to six cubic metres of soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Properties and use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo, &#039;the miracle plant&#039;, benefits approximately half the world&#039;s population, used as a commercial commodity and subsistence. It is known to be hardy, light and flexible, and sought for its nutritional and environmental value. It has more than 1500 documented applications, ranging from medicine to poison, and from toys to aircraft. Bamboo&#039;s many varieties and characteristics have helped humans in seemingly endless ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culm, the most economically important part of the plant, can grow to more than 40 m in just three to four months in some species, and one can literally watch it grow. In 35 years a bamboo plant can produce some 15 km of usable pole, of up to 30 cm diameter. The annual global crop of bamboo is estimated to be ten million tonnes, or approximately eight million km, enough to girdle the earth 200 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ancient times, Asians have relied on bamboo roots, leaves, sap and ash to remedy minor and major ailments, particularly in traditional Indian and Chinese health care. Tabasheer, a silica containing substance found in the culms of many species of bamboo, is used in medicine and as a catalyst for certain chemicals. Current research is further exploring bamboo&#039;s medicinal potentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo also provides people a healthier environment, in many different ways. Besides sequestering carbon, and easing the impact of tropical rains, it also lowers light intensity and offers protection against ultraviolet rays. A pioneering plant (which provided the first re-greening of Hiroshima), it provides the fastest-growing canopy possible for degraded lands, creating micro-climates for other life and yielding more oxygen than equivalent stands of trees. A bamboo forest can even be part of a natural environmental cleansing system that converts pollution into plant nutrients while producing valuable crops. Bamboo finds many commercial uses in such fields as the rayon, handloom, fishing and sericulture industries. It provides millions of jobs and supports key economic sectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;in China alone, bamboo industries generate more than US $ two billion annually;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India, bamboo is used in the US $ 400 million incense stick industry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo-related activities in India generate about 432 million workdays and US $ 600 million in wages annually (Adkoli, 1996 from Bamboo, People and the Environment);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in Thailand and other Asian countries, it is used as ar important raw material for industries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bamboo has multiple economic possibilities, important ecological value, and enormous ability to meet the needs of people and industries (especially those in rural areas)_ Unfortunately, far too little attention has been paid, up to now, to the management of natural bamboo stands and to ensuring that there will be a sustainable supply of this raw material in the future. This results in constraining and reduces the potential benefits and value of bamboo use. Related development issues, problems and prospects, are identifiable in three areas of focus;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resource mobilisation and improved management, technologies and processing techniques (valued by customers, knowledge-based and accepted globally);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy interventions to ensure a sustained supply of bamboo and to elevate bamboo to the mainstream as a viable substitute for (tropical) timber;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education, public awareness and international cooperation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Women and bamboo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite conscious national policies to reduce gender disparities, women continue to have less access to better paying jobs. In fact, according to U ND P World Development Report, in no society do women enjoy the same opportunities as men and are disproportionately represented among low-paying jobs or work in the informal sector. Althoug­considerable progress in developing women&#039;s capabilities has been achieved their participation in the labour market remains very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bamboo sector though not a high-profile sector, has &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;provided women opportunities to participate in the labour force. In most countries where bamboo grows and is used, women form a major part of the work force. In China up to 70 per cent of workers in bamboo-processing factories are women, as are about 80 per cent of the workers in Vietnam&#039;s home-based bamboo enterprises. In India women make up the majority of mat-weavers and makers of incense sticks. The flexibility of scheduling such activities enables women to contribute to their household income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Challenges      .&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite bamboo&#039;s economic potential, its ecological benefits, and its relevance for poverty alleviation, the resources base has been under managed and is commonly overexploited, especially in Asia. This results in the harvesting of mediocre material, inadequate efforts to regenerate depleted areas, and the generally unsuitable management of natural stands. A first step to correct this situation would be to undertake an inventory of the extent and distribution of existing bamboo resources (at the regional, national and global level) to allow for sound planning in bamboo dependent industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second challenge to the realization of bamboo&#039;s socioeconomic potential is the developmental imbalance that exists in the industrial use of this resource. The fast-growing bamboo trade, in both domestic and export markets, create heavy competition among bamboo producing countries. While some nations (and provinces) have achieved remarkable results, other resource-rich countries are lagging behind in bamboo development. In addition, standards and quality control need to be developed, while certain technologies require major refinements; such as, improved processing techniques with an emphasis on creating greater durability and a better finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to modernise both the design of bamboo products and their use. Where bamboo was once favoured, plastic and metals are often being sustained because they are uniform, cheap, durable and readily available. The challenge is to analyse customer needs and to identify commercial opportunities (i.e. market segments, end users, product types such as ply-boo). At the national level, there is clear need for coordination and organisation among the various sub-sectors, so that action plans can be created for development of the bamboo industry. In other words, bamboo must be put on the development agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another major challenge is the need for public education campaigns, as well as training at different levels, to correct the popular perception of bamboo as an antiquated material, unable to compete with more &#039;modern&#039; alternatives. With new technical inputs and innovative marketing, renewed interest can be generated; bamboo&#039;s image can be changed from that of the &#039;poor-man&#039;s timber&#039; into achieving its appropriate status as a material of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the small-to-medium size of the industry, few standards exist for most products made from bamboo. Among the few exceptions there are the national standards adopted in China and India for certain panel products. The development of codes and standards is essential for growth of the bamboo industry and acceptance of bamboo as being at par with timber and other construction materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Past, Present, Future&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used for millennia for a wide range of day-to-day purposes, both as a woody material and as food, bamboo has been the backbone of much of the world&#039;s rural life and will remain so as populations increase. Bamboo will continue to play an important part in the development of enterprises and the transformation of rural environments in all the regions of the developing world where it grows.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many parts of rural Asia, and for indigenous forest communities, &#039;bamboo for living&#039; and &#039;living with bamboo&#039; is still the norm, and this plant-of-1500-uses offers an excellent entry point for rural poverty alleviation. Bamboo can also provide a valuable model for the sustainable development of other non-timber forest products and benefit women and other underprivileged people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is thus not a material of times past, but one that has countless and growing uses today, even in the industrialised countries. It also has renewed prospects for enriching human development, and holds the potential&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;p&gt;For improvement of rural communities;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the sustainable development of the environment;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the production of industrial products;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a 215t century alternative to timber.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green markets are growing, and offer new opportunities for the promotion of bamboo as an alternative to wood. All stakeholders have a major responsibility to promote bamboo&#039;s environmental image as a genuine timber substitute. Bamboo is highly versatile, lending itself to distinct and unique furniture designs, to new-generation building materials, and to a vast range of items, thereby generating countless jobs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widespread and adaptable to different climates, user-friendly and accessible, ecologically virtuous, bamboo has major, under-realised potential to benefit the social and economic development, and strengthen the autonomy, of enormous numbers of people, especially those living in countless rural communities. The &#039;miracle plant&#039; can have a strong, positive impact in coming decades on many aspects of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>BAMFEST 2005 (2nd International North East India Bamboo Festival)</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/bamfest-2005-2nd-international-north-east-india-bamboo-festival</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bamboo today contributes to the subsistence needs of over a billion people, and has played a significant role in human society since time immemorial. Traditional uses as varied as fuel, food, housing and shelter, tools, and music comprise but a part of the broad spectrum of bamboo use. At the same time, equally important are bamboo&#039;s industrial uses and its potential role in mankind&#039;s future. Bamboo for pulp and paper, construction and engineering materials, panel products, and an array of modern uses are becoming better known. To better realise these new uses and to benefit the communities where the resource base and the traditions of use are well rooted, a number of development issues must be addressed. Resource mobilisation and management, technology and processing, policy, and international education and cooperation must be emphasised in developing a future for bamboo as the timber of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North East of India is a region that is abundant in &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;natural resources. It is also home to two-thirds of India&#039;s total resources of Bamboo. Touted as the &quot;poor man&#039;s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;timber&quot;, bamboo has today been acknowledged as the principal substitute for timber. The North-Eastern region of India has the greatest concentration of cane and bamboo in the country. The raw stock is valued at around Rs. 5,000 crore. With suitably feasible schemes of value additions of even just about two times, approximately Rs. 10,000 crore can be easily generated in the North East alone on an annual basis. Even for a moment, assuming that one is able to utilise only about 25 per cent of the resource base, the North East can easily generate Rs. 2,500 crore a year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the objective of highlighting the role that bamboo can play in alleviating poverty, generating employment, contributing to the environment and promoting,tourism, the Second North East Bamboo Festival is being organised from May 02 — 04, 2005 at Shillong by the Cane and Bamboo Technology Centre, Guwahati in collaboration with the Government of Meghalaya. The N EH HDC, M H HDC, IFAD, GTZ, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India will be supporting the Festival. The North Eastern Council, Shillong will facilitate the holding of the Festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Festival has also been accorded recognition by the World Bamboo Organisation (WBO) as an International Event in their Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Highlights of the Bamboo Festival&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bamboo and cane Craft exhibition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food festival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo music festival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo cultural programmes of different tribes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo Tourism/ Field visits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshops on rural housing/product design/training and entrepreneurship/tools and equipments /poster and essay competitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional knowledge on bamboo and customary usages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo games and sports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Although bamboo and cane have been integral to the culture and economics of many people in India, they &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;are being &#039;rediscovered&#039; in recent years. Their attributes and potential are progressively being recognised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the State Government level, it is the Governments of the North East, which have the greatest interest and the most &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;stakes in the development of the sector. The comparative advantage in primary resources is only one element contributing to their interest. Their cultural and traditional associations with the material, confidence in their own skills, the lack of -alternative vehicles for stimulating economic activity in the region are equally important factors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;The North Eastern Region of India is a place where bamboo has its &quot;roots&quot; and &quot;shoots&quot;. It holds the largest reserves of bamboo in the world. Given this fact, it is no wonder that the people of the region take bamboo for granted. From cradle to coffin and from houses to bridges, bamboo plays a pivotal role in the daily life of each and every individual without anyone of them ever realising the fact that without bamboo life may cease to exist, at least in this region. People here have used it from time immemorial. But as it often happens, the fact remains that bamboo has been taken for granted and little thought has ever been given to its vast potential. Bamboo is like a golden thread that has been woven into the culture of the North East.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAM FEST is a concept, which will be carried forward in the years to come. This is the Second North East Bamboo Festival. In the years to come, similar shows need to be organised at different locations all over the North Eastern Region and can even be held outside the region, if resources permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objectives                                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Revival of traditional crafts of the region&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To highlight local customs and usage of bamboo&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To exhibit the capabilities and export potential of craftspeople, who are involved with processing and semi-processing of bamboo&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To forge closer linkages and networking amongst craftspeople from the different States through exchange and sharing of experience&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To discuss common issues for adopting newer technologies in the field of craftsmanship&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To provide a brand-name and a common platform to the crafts groups from the North East&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate awareness about the cane and bamboo sector, which is largely ignored by the market&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help project bamboo as the essential substitute for timber in the years to come&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-april-2005&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B April 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The panel, which held a meeting earlier to discuss the despatch of bamboo building materials to the worst-affectec areas in the country decided to send one lakh sticks to Tami Nadu during the first phase of providing relief aid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Minister Zoramthanga presided over the meeting. ThE State Environment and Forest department were assignee the responsibility of supervising collection of bamboo frorr jungle groves. The bamboo was sent by road to Guwahati, from where it was transported to Tamil Nadu via Kol kat­by rail by the Mizoram Government.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bamboo flower could cause widespread famine and unrest in Mizoram</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/bamboo-flower-could-cause-widespread-famine-and-unrest-mizoram</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government of the North Eastern Indian State of Mizoram is concerned these days about the fact that a species of bamboo is all set to flower after 48 years. The flowers, which are considered a bad omen by the Mizos, lead to the proliferation of rats, which in turn brings about a famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The bamboo, which is known as &quot;Mautam&quot; meaning famine by the locals, is from a small family of bamboo whose flowers produce protein rich seeds, which when consumed by rats leads to more fertility and reproduction amongst them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rats then tend to attack the local farmer&#039;s crops as well as stored cereals and rice. The last time the bamboo had flowered in 1958, the famine it caused led to 20 years of guerrilla warfare between Mizoram and Delhi, reports The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State officials are now reportedly taking frantic measures to stop the damage from taking place. Not only are they cutting down the bamboo trees, they are also providing farmers with pest control toxins and making a buffer stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State&#039;s Chief Minister, Zoramthanga, avers that the oncoming calamity could be used to their advantage as the bamboo could be used by cottage industries to make furniture and other goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-april-2005&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B April 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Plan body for a Bamboo Directorate</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/plan-body-bamboo-directorate</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Planning Commission has thrown up an idea to form a National Bamboo Development Board and expand the present Rs. 2,600 crore Bamboo Mission into a full-fledged directorate.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-feasibility report has already been scrutinised by the Agriculture Ministry, and the final report is expected to be placed before the Cabinet by February next year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme, which includes an addition of two million hectares of land for bamboo plantation, may generate 8.6 million jobs. It is believed that the U PA government, which has been looking for creating job avenues to fulfil its promises in the CM P, is likely to accept the proposal. &quot;With an addition to two million hectares of land, the total land under bamboo plantation will increase to 8.9 million hectares. People will be needed not only at the stage of cultivation, but lakhs of jobs will be created at the primary processing centres, which we are planning in our new scheme,&quot; said a Planning Commission official.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an expansion of bamboo plantation is a key to meet the Plan target of covering 33 per cent of areas under forests. Next only to China, India has the richest bamboo genetic resources with 136 species. But with a market of Rs. 2,000 crore, it falls nowhere in the $10 billion global bamboo bazaar.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we wish to exploit the bamboo market totally, the entire mission is to be handled by a proper directorate. We must have a proper structure and separate administration to look into areas like finance, administration, marketing etc. We can&#039;t forget that our domestic market itself is huge and there&#039;s no problem of investment. In fact, the Government may not pump in all the expenditure. The idea is to make the business of bamboo a profitable venture,&quot; the official added.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-april-2005&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B April 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Manipur artisans handcrafting their way to ASEAN markets</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/manipur-artisans-handcrafting-their-way-asean-markets</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With India pursuing a Look East policy with a lot more vigour than before, an attempt to integrate the economy of the North East is now being made in the hope of forging long term links with member nations of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this goal is being met by artisans of Manipur and other North Eastern States actively promoting their hand­made products recently, a Manipur Trade Fair was organised in Assam&#039;s principal city of Guwahati by the North Eastern Development Financial Institution (NEDFi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hands appear to be busier than ever before. Markets have come calling on these artisans. Bamboo growers are now on a high and nurturing their fields with greater care. It&#039;s a life time opportunity for them. The North East&#039;s untapped resources and talents are now being tapped in a big way to make the region India&#039;s next vibrant economic hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today World is moving more and more into hand made things than premium items. World is moving more and more into the organic art of agriculture produces. 80 per cent of the produce of the North East is organic. Chemical fertilisers are hardly used because the soil is very fertile. Therefore this market has to be capitalised. I don&#039;t see any limitation to the market. As such I see great deal of opportunity which is existing,&quot; Dr. Surajit M itra, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Development of North East Region expressed this opinion recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Third North East Trade Fair in Guwahati this time emphasised on Manipuri handicrafts and dance. &quot;This exhibition has given opportunity to many individuals and organisations to market their products. Craftsmen and artisans of Manipur are highly skilled and their products are unique and different,&quot; claimed Ashok, a Consultant with the Society for Handicrafts and Goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipuri handicrafts vary from flower and paper baskets to `Khambal dolls, leather works to items of bell metal, not to speak of the traditional bamboo and cane items. It is this wide and unique range that attracts traders from as far as Mumbai to such type of exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have seen the Manipur exhibition at different places so many times. Goods from here are I Wed across the country. It is the uniqueness of the products that has brought me to this place. I like many things here. I will try to connect these local products with the cultural way of life of the country,&quot; said Vinay Chhibar, a trader from Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With India giving Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to the ten-member AS EAN grouping, a wonderful economic opportunity to tap the North Eastern States is there for the asking.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Union Budget to revive Bamboo Mission</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/union-budget-revive-bamboo-mission</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a gap of nearly two years, the Union  Budget 2005-06 will see allocations for the BamboO Mission as a means of sustained employment. The National Mission on Bamboo Technology and Trade Development was a programme initiated by the NDA government. The project had been gathering dust. Reliable sources indicate that the new Budget could provide an allocation of Rs. 200 crore for the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Budget would provide a mix of generating sustained employment with ad-hoc employment generation to get over a chronic problem facing the country. A national levet strategic perspective and action plan for the development of the bamboo sector is regarded as the need of the hour.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated by the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) that the total world market of bamboo in value terms is ten billion dollars, that is, Rs. 50,000 crore. The total size of the bamboo industry in India is estimated by UNIDO to be Rs. 6,505 crore in 2004.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is further estimated by the UNIDO that the Bamboo Industry in India can grow to Rs. 16,000 crore by the end of the 11th Plan and to Rs. 26,000 crore by 2015. The highest growth is expected in the new generation bamboo products which would be technology driven.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong view in the Government that with necessary technology and trade development support, efforts can be made to achieve the target of Rs. 26,000 crore by the end of 11th Plan itself.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, bamboo is being used as low value product without adequate technology support and therefore the wastage is more. Traditional knowledge and skills of artisans working with bamboo have not been upgraded and the industries utilising bamboo are still functioning the old way. The resultant effect is that value addition does not commensurate to the labour put in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts are of the view that several steps are required to overcome this problem. These are up gradation of traditional skills, making pack flat furniture, developing the designs and products, technology support for providing new products, up gradation of machinery and tools for enhanced production and efficiency; bamboo steel scaffolding and development to avoid tension-induced buckling, development of various food products from bamboo shoots and manufacturing activated carbon from lops and tops.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the main segment of bamboo based employment generation would be handicrafts. It is estimated that at present about ten million people are dependent on bamboo for their livelihood in the handicrafts sector. Their involvement is seasonal and wages earned from the activity is quite low categorising the majority of them as Below Poverty Line.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two million people from the segment with re-training and orientation would be provided with gainful employment Additional three million employment would be generated under various handicraft business mainly in the rural areas_&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-april-2005&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B April 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>India, China and their contrasting Bamboo stories</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/india-china-and-their-contrasting-bamboo-stories</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From toothpicks to baskets, furniture to lacquer ware, mats to musical instruments, from toys to talking sticks, bamboo can make it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo&#039;s natural elegance and easy workability makes it a choice material for handicrafts, That is why China manufactures over 8,000 items made of bamboo and earns $ 130 million dollars through exo official study shows. Moreover, bamboo, the study raw material for industries and about half of • boo consumption Is for paper pulp. Bamboo is al c a the production of rayon, activated charcoal, flooring and panelling products, and now serious efforts are being made to take the bamboo straight to rural areas of the country for the benefit of farmers in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A head start was made two years ago when the Badrinath Temple Committee began distributing prasao&#039; in baskets of s&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;lick &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;ringal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;(a bamboo specie) to generate income for the local Rudia community of Chamoli District.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hesco, an NGO which is actively working in the Himalayan region, provided the technical know-how to the Rudias in this regard, according to Hesco Director Anil P Joshi. The Forest Research Institute (FRI) has also come forward to contribute its expertise in the bamboo sector. &quot;We are ready to take our knowledge on bamboo to rural areas of India/&#039; says Paramjit Singh, official spokesman of the FRI which has taken a lead role in starting training programmes exclusively for farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 farmers from Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal have attended a six-day course in the FRI campus for setting up a modern bamboo nursery, raising seeds through vegetative methods and tissue cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were also shown technologies pertaining to long duration preservation and utilisation as well as methods to control diseases emanating from fungus and insects in order to safeguard the bamboo crop. &quot;Till date, bamboo is synonymous with the Northeast. What we are doing now is to take its advantage to the rest of India,&quot; says Mr. Singh, also a scientist at the FRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Uttaranchal Government has also launched major efforts in making bamboo play a major role in the socio-economic life of the people of the hill state which is under 65 per cent forest cover. According to Chief Secretary R.S. Tolia, &quot;We should learn a lesson from China whose per unit production is 6 to 7 per cent more than ours. China earns a lot of foreign exchange through export of bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicating the Chinese experiment, the State Government is now inviting investments in this sector. Delhi-based Eland International Pvt Ltd has pledged an investment of Rs. 265 crore for promoting plantation of bamboo and manufacture of its products in Uttaranchal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-april-2005&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B April 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
