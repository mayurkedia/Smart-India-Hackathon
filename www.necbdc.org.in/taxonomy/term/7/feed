&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The main purpose of the meeting was to have a brainstorming exercise for the development of the agarbatti supply chain in the region. It is deduced that 70% to 80% of the stick used by the nation&#039;s agarbatti industry comes from North East region alone and the estimated market turnover is to the tune of Rs 1900 Crore growing @ 10% every year, providing livelihood to over 5 million people. The local players are dominating over 80% of the value as of now. The volume of ITC requirement is approximately 50 metric tonnes per month.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Besides the CBTC officials and Shri VM Rajsekharan, CEO, ITC and Shri C Srinivasan, Operations Manager, ITC Agarbatti Division, the meeting was attended by official delegatesfrom UNIDO,AIDC, and different state government organizations and other enterprises.&lt;/div&gt;

The Plinth was already made with concrete bythe Tourism Department when the CBTC was approached to take up the project. The construction was planned with the Bamboo poles combined with Mat board panel for walls. This unique way of making such structure helped in reducing the Cost and the time taken for completion. As a large number of cottages had to be made ready before the impending tourist season, this method of construction helped in maintaining the time line and also gave a unique look to the structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Year of Construction - 2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of Project - Rs. 2.50 lakhs per cottage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time taken for completion - 180 days (for 8 cottages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The project was initiated by the Tourism Department for tourist lodge in the world famous wild life sanctuary of Kaziranga, Assam.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

The structure was made with a Bamboo columns and a large span truss over the &lt;/span&gt;space. There was also a lot of provision for fixing glass as the area needed to be well ventilated and &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;bright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;The construction gave a lot of exposure to the students studying in the institute. The project was jointly funded by the Handique College and CBTC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>CBTC and Bamboo Housing Activities</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/cbtc-and-bamboo-housing-activities</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.necbdc.org.in/sites/default/files/article/housing%20cbtc.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBTC was formed in the year 2000 under the UNDP/UNIDO Country Program for India and since it inception the CBTC has the mandate to develop the bamboo sector in the region. Since then it has embarked upon a concerted effort to contribute to the development of bamboo resources and development of craft and uses of bamboo in the region with the sole objective of improving the life and habitat of people form the region through the locally available materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004 CBTC became a registered Body under Societies Act. CBTC has also been designated as a Bamboo Technology Support Group (BTSG) for the North Eastern and Eastern states under National Bamboo Mission (NBM). CBTC has also entered into an MOU with the Building Material Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) under the Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation, for promotion of bamboo housing technology in the region since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good part of the effort has been to popularize the use of bamboo for a sustainable and eco-friendly use in the low cost housing sector. As the area already has a tradition of building with bamboo, we at CBTC have concentrated on improving the skills and techniques of bamboo construction and demonstrated a unique way of building with bamboo that is cost efficient and durable. Our work has created a much-needed awareness in showing the feasibility of using bamboo to come up with low cost, aesthetic and practical habitat solutions. A wide acceptance of our structures in the tourism sector has enhanced this view. The acceptance of our techniques and efforts in this sector shows the versatility of bamboo and rids it of its drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our primary areas of concern have been to address the following issues:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost effectiveness&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green and eco friendly material — Bamboo&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durability&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earthquake resistance&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional know how — indigenous skills&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up gradation of local architecture and skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The cost effective nature of the technique was of primary importance to us and we achieved it by using the material which is locally available and at the same time by harnessing the skills of the local bamboo workers. The minimum use of brick, steel and mortar made it an attractive model for use. Our work started from understanding the strengths of bamboo as a structural material and devising methods to converge it with traditional and modern techniques of construction from other sources. With this we were able to upgrade and come up with a new technique that satisfies all our areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of a bamboo structure in an earthquake prone region has also been of primary interest to everybody concerned. The structures are lightweight and follow proper framing techniques, which makes them very effective against an earthquake impact. This apart, the joinery details are done in such a manner that it allows the structure to absorb the shock during the earthquake impact. Overall we have been able to demonstrate our technique in terms of cost effectiveness, longevity and seismic stability. In all this, we have had proven success record and have now generated wide awareness and interest in the building sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have undertaken bamboo house construction for various organizations starting from the Block Level to State Governments of Nagaland, Assam, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura and Meghalaya. In addition, we have built for various tourism stakeholders in the region.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CBTC has full fledged Housing Section consisting of the Following staffs&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One full time architect&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One senior consulting architect (part time)&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One deputy manager&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One architectural assistant&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four trainers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bamboo as a Material for Housing and Buildings</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/bamboo-material-housing-and-buildings</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood has been used for centuries as a common material in construction of buildings and other structures. Similarly, bamboo has also a long and well established tradition for being used as a construction material throughout the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern context when forest cover is fast depleting and availability of wood is increasingly becoming scarce, the research and development undertaken in past few decades has established and amply demonstrated that bamboo could be a viable substitute of wood and several other traditional materials for housing and building construction sector and several infrastructure works. Its use through industrial processing has shown a high potential for production of composite materials and components which are cost-effective and can be successfully utilized for structural and non-structural applications in construction of housing and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main characteristic features, which make bamboo as a potential building material, are its high tensile strength and very good weight to strength ratio. The strength-weight ratio of bamboo also supports its use as a highly resilient material against forces created by high velocity winds and earthquakes. Above all bamboo is renewable raw material resource from agro-forestry and if properly treated and industrially processed, components made by bamboo can have a reasonable life of 30 to 40 years. The natural durability of bamboo varies according to species and the types of treatments. Varied uses and applications in building construction have established bamboo as an environment-friendly, energy‑efficient and cost-effective construction material. The commonly used species in construction are Bambusa balcooa, Bambusa bambos, Bambusa tulda, Dendrocalamus giganteous, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Dendrocalamus  asper etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo, a highly versatile resource and widely available, is being used asay engineering material for construction of houses and other buildings. A number of small and medium sized demonstration structures have already been constructed during past  few years. These have shown very good performance in different climates. In order to propagate use of bamboo in housing and building construction for wider application, awareness and confidence building amongst professionals and householders is required. This calls for organized actions on prototyping, demonstration, standardization aimed at improving acceptance levels and promoting appropriate construction practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;World-wide availability of Bamboo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(No. of bamboo species and coverage by country, In Asia)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/table3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over twenty million tones of bamboo are harvested each year,)with almost three fifths of it in India and China. Aq estimated 25 million people all over the world depend on or use bamboo materials. The table above indicates the distribution of bamboo in Asia. It is also serves to highlight the potential dominance of India with its vast resources and reserves of bamboo in future economic activity and trade.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, 28% of area and 66% of growing stock of bamboo in NE region and 20% of area and 12% of growing stock in MP &amp;amp; Chattisgarh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The housing and building construction industry is one of the largest consumers for natural mineral resources and forests. It is increasingly realized that innovative building materials and construction technologies which offer potential for environmental protection, employment generation, economy in construction and energy conservation need to be encouraged as best options to meet the rising demand of housing. Whole of north-east is prone to earthquakes and falls under Seismic Zone V. BMTPC lays emphasis on promoting design and construction of disaster resistant technologies for housing. Construction techniques using bamboo as main material have been found very suitable for earthquake resistant housing. With the constant rise in the cost of traditional building materials and with the poor affordability of large segments of our population the cost of an adequate house is increasingly going beyond the affordable limits of more than 30-35% of our population lying in the lower income segments. This calls for wide spread technology dissemination of cost effective building materials and construction techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo as a Building and Construction Material&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is structurally stronger than steel. At the same time, it is light-weight, easily workable, and has vibration damping and heat insulation properties. Structurally, bamboo can find application in three &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;main types of structures: scaffolding, housing, and roads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is being used for scaffolding in most of the countries where it grows. In fact, despite construction becoming high-rise, bamboo has continued to hold advantages over other materials such as steel, which has entered the scaffolding market recently. Steel scaffolding is available as an industrial product of standardized dimensions that make it quick to erect and dismantle. Moreover, steel can be used at least 50 times more than bamboo, which can be used five to ten times at most depending upon the load of the construction. In this respect, bamboo scaffolding needs some technical upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, bamboo is a preferred scaffolding material because its flexibility in the variety of lengths that it can be cut into, the lower investments that contractors need to make in the scaffolding stocks (bamboo costs just 6 per cent of the price of steel for similar quantity of scaffolding) and the ease with which it can be set up and dismantled. It is the preferred scaffolding option even in developed countries such as Hong Kong and continues to be used for the majority of high-rise buildings in these countries In India too the usage of bamboo for the purpose of scaffolding is on the higher side. There is virtually no value addition on the raw bamboo used for scaffolding purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bamboo-a Housing material&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a structural application, bamboo rounds are used to create roof support systems. These systems include a prefabricated triangular truss comprising units eight metres long. A truss can be carried by four people, and deflects only 2.5 cm along its entire length. It is covered with bamboo boards, lath and plaster to create a waterproof roof. This system utilises bamboo rafters with bamboo boards, which are plastered on both sides, and fired clay tiles are used to waterproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo flooring a n d bamboo board are newly developed interior designing material made using modern scientific methods from superior quality bamboo. Bamboo flooring is an attractive alternative to wood or laminate flooring. Bamboo with a wall thickness of culm of at least 11 mm is suitable for making floorboards. The process of making bamboo strip flooring consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hollow bamboo of a minimum thickness of 11 mm is sliced into strips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These strips are milled to a thickness of 7 mm. They are then boiled to remove the starch and treated for anti-moth, anti-mildew, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The strips are then dried and carbonized (if required).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dried strips are now milled to 5 mm thickness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These strips are now glued and laminated into solid boards under high pressure, which are then milled into standard strip flooring profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machinery and equipment required for &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;manufacturing bamboo flooring can be imported from Taiwan, though some is available locally as well. Floors can be made out of flattened bamboo, woven bamboo mats or split bamboo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;As reinforcement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four categories in which the use of bamboo has been made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bamboo fibres in cement mortar for roofing sheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split bamboo as reinforcing bars in concrete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo as a form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo as a soil reinforcement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For Roofing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo Mat Corrugated Roofing Sheet has been developed by BMTPC in close collaboration with Indian Plywood Research and Training Institute (IPIRTI) Bangalore, India. It is made from woven bamboo mats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For Walls&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woven bamboo mats are used to make walls in countries such as Bangladesh and India. Vertical whole or halved culms and flattened bamboo strips are also used for making walls. Walls can be made with bamboo as a minor component and mud as a major one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For Doors and Windows&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo can be fashioned artistically to make doors and windows&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BMTPC&#039;s Initiatives in Promotion of Bamboo in Housing &amp;amp; Buildings&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Building Materials &amp;amp; Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) under the Ministry of Housing &amp;amp; Urban Poverty Alleviation, Govt. of India is actively involved in development of bamboo based technologies and to promote these technologies in the North-Eastern Region including other bamboo growing areas, by encouraging commercial production of bamboo based products, construction of demonstration houses and setting up of Bamboo Mat Production Centres for processing of bamboo, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Mat Corrugated Roofing Sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;The BMTPC in collaboration with Indian Plywood Industries Research &amp;amp; Training Institute (IPIRTI), Bangalore, have developed a technology for manufacturing of Bamboo Mat Corrugated Sheet (BMCS) which is durable, strong, waterproof, and decay-insect-fire resistant. The commercial production has been started at Byrnihat, Meghalaya. The product has been accepted by the consumers and is becoming increasing popular as a roofing option in the north east part of the country. It is estimated that in full capacity this unit will generate livelihood for nearly 7000 women/men (through mat weaving) in rural regions where bamboo is abundantly grown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Mat Corrugated Ridge Cap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMTPC in collaboration with IPIRTI, Bangalore, has also developed a technology for manufacturing of Bamboo Mat Corrugated Ridge Cap for roofing. The Technology is ready for commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Construction of Demonstration Structures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMTPC has constructed 24 demonstration structures in Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya using bamboo based technologies. These include Houses, OPD buildings, Library buildings, Picnic huts, Schools, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;etc. The cost of construction using conventional technologies in these areas is around Rs. 800/- per sq ft. This is considerably reduced using bamboo based technologies and the cost of construction achieved is Rs.315 to Rs.622 per sq.ft. for different types of structures. The specifications used are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treated bamboo columns and beams,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrocement walls on bamboo grid reinforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treated bamboo trusses, rafters and purlins,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo mat board in wooden frames for door shutters,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo Mat Corrugated Roofing Sheets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPS flooring, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Development of Technology for Construction of two storey Bamboo Housing System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technology for construction of two storey bamboo housing system has been developed and a demonstration house has been constructed at the campus of IPIRTI Bangalore. At each stage of house construction various elements were tested and models of such elements were made before the actual construction was carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design and Development of Pre­fabricated Modular Housing System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMTPC has undertaken Design and Development of p&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;refabricated modular housing system using bamboo and bamboo based composites in collaboration with IPIRTI, Bangloare. A model design of prefab double walled bamboo composite &lt;/span&gt;house attached bath and kitchen having size 20&#039; x 24&#039; x 8&#039; was developed. This system will enable application of bamboo composite building materials in prefabricated houses. These types of houses can be constructed quite quickly for immediate and long term rehabilitation for post disaster relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Mat Production Centres&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMTPC along with Cane &amp;amp; Bamboo Technology Centre (CBTC) in cooperation with State Governments is establishing Bamboo Mat Production Centres in the States of Assam, Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Kerala. The main objectives of Bamboo Mat Production Centres are to provide uninterrupted supply of bamboo mats to the manufacturing units of bamboo based building components for increasing the productivity, quality, to provide training in mat production process and to create employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council has established such Bamboo Mat Production Centres in Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Kerala.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMTPC and CBTC are also providing training on bamboo mat production to the artisans from each Bamboo Mat Production Centres. The production capacity of each production centre will be 300 mats per day. It is estimated that the each Centre will be able to produce the mat at the rate of Rs.35 per mat and would be able to sell at the rate of Rs.45 per mat. This provides employment generation of nearly 150 women/men per day i.e. 45,000 women/men days per year per Centre. Besides the above, the Centres can also generate income by supplying bamboo sticks made out of bamboo waste, to the artisans for making handicraft items. The mats produced by Bamboo Mat Production Centres are likely to be utilized by various manufacturers who are producing Bamboo Mat Corrugated Roofing Sheets and Bamboo Mat Boards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo - more than an alternative&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo has so far not been regarded as a substitute for wood. An analytical look at the applications for which wood is being used and the usage of bamboo indicates that it is possible to use bamboo for all the applications for which wood is being used. The usage of bamboo has in fact been established conclusively for categories that consume larger volumes of wood, namely, paper pulp, plywood, construction and furniture. There are preconceived notions about the technical capability of bamboo. These have hindered the adoption of bamboo as a wood substitute. The wood industry is not able to visualize bamboo as a process-friendly material that can peel. It also considers bamboo to be susceptible to fire, water and termites.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bamboo, if used efficiently, shall lead to the following in the interest of the nation and masses:&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Development&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training for skill up gradation&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment generation&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservation of forest timber&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulk utilization of bamboo &lt;/li&gt;

 <title>Preservation of Bamboo for the Construction of Houses for Low Income People</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/preservation-bamboo-construction-houses-low-income-people</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Costa Rican National Bamboo Project (NBP) was created to offer low-cost houses to help in the solution of the housing deficit. Initially, in 1988 the NBP worked under the administration of the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), (Projects COS 87/001 and COS 90/005), with financing from the Royal Government of the Netherlands (Chaves y Gutierrez, 1990). As of January 1996, all professional, technical and material resources of these projects were transferred to the Bamboo Foundation (FUNBAMBU), a nonprofit non-government organization presided over by the Minister of Housing and Human Settlements (MIVAH) and dedicated fundamentally to the construction of housing for low-income people. This Foundation has the function of perpetuating in a self-sustaining manner the gains and benefits of the National Bamboo Project (Gutierrez, 1998).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, nearly 3000 houses have been built and more than 300 ha of bamboo been planted. The government plans to extend the plantations up to 2000 ha in the near future.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need of bamboo preservation. When the project started, insect attack of the bamboo in use was a very serious problem Today, the durability of bamboo is no longer in question, since it was possible to find effective, low-cost preservatives and to develop simple and efficacious systems for its treatment. In recent years, the demand for bamboo culms for the construction of houses has considerably increased. Besides it has become necessary to treat several thousand of culms and laths, for furniture making, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;handicraft, construction parts, for the local market as well as for exports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo culms provide an excellent structural material for many purposes. Its use, however, is restricted because of their low resistance against degradation by fungi and insects. Whereas fungal decay can be prevented by architectonic and constructive details that keep the bamboo dry, insect attack can be avoided efficiently only by a suitable chemical preservation. The possible treatment techniques for bamboo have recently been summarized in numerous papers, for example: Liese (1980, 1997), Sulthoni (1987), Kumar et al. (1994).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wider application of the bamboo preservation is. however, rare. This is mainly duetothefact that bamboo is a low-cost material, which would become more expensive and less accessible to the poor after proper preservation, although it may be more economical at the end. In addition, bamboo culms show a refractory behavior towards penetration compared to timber. which difficulties simpler preservation methods like immersion. A continuous market demand of durable material is required to merit the necessary treatment installations and to develop the technical skills.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Preservation Research in Costa Rica&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resulting from consultations by the first author during the years 1988 to1992 (Liese, 1988, 1989, 1990a 1990b, 1992) and with the assistance of research done at the University of Costa Rica and the Technological Institute of Costa Rica, the methods and preservatives available in the country were analyzed. At the same time, the technical personnel of the BNP with the help of researchers and laboratory facilities at the mentioned universities conducted tests to be adapted to the treatment of bamboo in the rural areas of the country. It was necessary to treat bamboo culms as well as &quot;esterilla&quot; (culms spliced open with an ax into a flattened kind of board) for the construction of houses as well as the production of furniture, handicraft, and decorative elements for buildings. Later on, it became necessary to treat, besides &quot;esterilla&quot;, also &quot;reglilla&quot; (small boards or laths obtained by longitudinally sawing the bamboo culms). First trials for the application of boron preservatives were done either by soaking or by sap-displacement for round bamboo pieces and dip-diffusion was tested for the treatment of &quot;esterilla&quot; (spliced bamboo) and &quot;reglilla&quot; (laths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selection of the treatment methods. After those preliminary trials it was decided to concentrate research on the treatment of culms to be used as structural members by the sap-displacement process. This method appeared effective, environment-friendly, and particularly suitable for the treatment of bamboo for houses in the rural areas of Costa Rica. For the treatment of Guadua culms, the sap-displacement method compared with other methods, such as long period immersion, gives the best results regarding penetration, distribution, and retention of the preservative and is less time consuming in the operation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For preservative treatment of &quot;esterilla&quot; and &quot;reglilla&quot; a dip-immersion/diffusion process was tested in the laboratory as well as in the field. Taking into consideration the great potential of contamination and misuse of the preservatives obtained from the first trials, it was recommended to apply the dip-diffusion method only at a few centralized places as close as possible to the plantations, and to have the work done only by skilled labor under proper supervision. Nowadays, as it will be, xplained later on, a preservative treatment for laths has been developed as an improved, effective, and safe way to treat the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sap-replacement treatment also called Boucherie process after its French inventor A. Boucherie in 1839 (Willeitner and Liese, 1992) has been applied since long for the treatment of wooden poles. Its use for bamboo was first tried in India by Narayanamurti et al. (1947) and was further developed to the &quot;modified Boucherie treatment&quot; by Purushotham et al. (1954) and Liese (1955).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although encouraging results were obtained from these experiments, its practical use remained rather limited, because several parameters needed further clarification for its use on a semi-commercial scale. Based on the literature about bamboo preservation and practical experiences in several Asian countries, the research at PNB was directed to the testing of several parameters, which had to be defined previously to a commercial operation at a larger scale. It was especially necessary to answer the following &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;What kind of pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;servative to use?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will be the response of Guadua bamboo to sap-displacement treatment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the parameters necessary to obtain a good penetration?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of equipment will be necessary to treat Guadua culms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of protection will be obtained for the treated material?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the costs and times for the preservation of the culms and laths by this process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting the preservative. Since the final price of the treated bamboo culms for the construction of low-cost houses has to be maintained as low as possible, the costs for bamboo preservation must also be low. At the same time, the treatment should be reliable to insure the expected duration and performance of the material. From the first tests done it seemed to be a very difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a dozen products nationally available in the market, which manufacturers claimed to be &quot;good&quot; for the preservation of timber, were tested. However, m&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;ost of these products had to be rejected when the following criteria of selection were adopted:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A competent and responsible manufacturer or distributor of the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reasonable priced product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good preservation properties, especially against Dinoderus spp. and other insects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good distribution of the preservative within the culm by diffusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low toxicity to human beings and low environmental risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many facts were considered, a preservative with boron as an active component was selected. This type of preservative has generally good preservation properties, good diffusion rates, low environmental effects towards human beings and animals and is &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;quite economic in price. The main disadvantage  being &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;that it does not posses chemical fixing properties and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;in consequence, the treated material can be leached &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;out if it is not well protected against humidity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preservative TIMBOR showed most of requirements needed. However, since TIMBOR  not imported into the country, preliminary trials vive done using the product &quot;Menorel-8&quot; (SOLUBOR). This product is manufactured as a foliage fertilizer and e widely distributed in Costa Rica. It consists mainly of Disodium Octoborate Tetrahydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with an active boron content of 66.1 %, expresses as B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Anatomical Considerations for &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;the Sap-Displacement Treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impregnating stage. As it has been mentioned, since a bamboo culm is resistant to lateral penetration by its hard skin, the appropriate idea of the Boucherie treatment for an axial liquid exchange was taken up. Along the culm length, both at the inner and outer part, the vessels run straight without any branching or obstructing connections of single vessel members (Fig. 1). Nodes, however, interrupt the easy fluid transport. Observations of the nodal structure have revealed that many vessels turn lateral changing their size into shorter cells with many perforations for an intensive interconnection with other vessel members. Thus, the diaphragm, as the inner part of the nodal area, provides a distribution of liquid and sap in the vessels and sieve tubes of the phloem to all sides of the culm (Ding and Liese, 1995). Obstacles between &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;these cells reduce an easy flow. Apart from the twisl and realignment in the nodal part, some vessels do not turn in but run straight through into the following vessel, as shown in Fig. 2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long stretching vessels are thus perfect pathways for the exchange of sap by the preservation solution However, a main obstacle has to be considered k- :-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;successful treatment: the vessels occupy only a small area of the whole cross section to be proteciec. Whereas for an axial penetration of softwoods. the lumina of tracheids provide 60-70 % cross-sectiona area, and the vessels in diffuse porous hardwoocts amount to 20-30 %, bamboo has only about 5-8 41- vessel area (Liese, 1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Total vessel area available for liquid flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get more information about the vessel area available, some detailed investigations were made kw Guadua &quot;Sur&quot; and Guadua &quot;Atlantico&quot;, the two main Guaduas that have been planted in Costa Rica. Internodal parts were cut from the bottom, middle, and top portion of the culm. Samples were taken &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;from each disk from two opposite sides, divided into their outer and inner half. The measurements were made with an Image Analyzer (CUE-3, Olympus) at 40 times magnification. After a delicate preparation, the metaxylem vessels could be clearly differentiated from the fibers and parenchyma. The results are summarized in table 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/table1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures about the vessel area demonstrate considerable differences, since the vessel area at the inner half is about double than that of the outer half. Moreover, the vessel size increases considerably from the bottom to the top, both at the inner and outer half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average vessel area for the two Guaduas reveals different mean values, since Guadua &quot;Sur&quot; showed distinctly lower values. As both Guaduas differed considerably in their flow behavior in the preliminary testing, the average vessel size of the two Guaduas was further analyzed as shown in table 2. The results of such measurements demonstrate that Guadua &quot;Sur&quot; has considerably smaller vessels, which could account for the lower vessel area and the longer treatment time experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/table2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent of the respective vessel area, the bamboo culms must be treated as fresh as possible, because soon after their felling the vessels are filled by a blockage due to cellular outgrowths (tyloses) and slime (Fig. 3). Therefore, both ends have to be cut off immediately before the treatment for a clean surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion phase. For an effective treatment of the bamboo culm by the sap-replacement process it is important to realize that even a complete filling of all the vessels covers less then 10 % of the whole tissue to be treated and that the remaining large portion stays liable for degradation. Consequently, the sap replacement phase has to be followed by a second treatment phase, namely the diffusion of the preservative from the vessels into the surrounding fiber sheaths and bundles as well as the parenchyma. In order to provide the maximum reservoir for such diffusion, nearly all vessels have to be completely filled with a sufficient high concentration. This will happen first to the larger vessels at the inner part of the culm and only later to the smaller vessels at the outer zone. Thus, the time necessary for the treatment will be governed by the time necessary for a complete exchange of the sap by the preservative solution&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Preservation at Funbambu&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the commercial production of treated bamboos using the sap-displacement method, several technical matters had to be settled or improved, which required a very tedious trial and error process, among them:&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some variables of the process are sensitive to the bamboo species being treated and therefore must be adjusted accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvesting and transport should be well-coordinated in order to keep the culms as fresh as possible, otherwise water storage facilities are necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, construction and operation of the treatment caps at the butt end are critical. They must be flexible and durable to accommodate repetitive deformations and displacements without brittle fracture of parts and spilling of liquid. Good connecting devices between culm and cap are essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The caps must include a special device to allow for the complete air removal from the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adequate pressure should be maintained at all times of the treatment process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean water must be used for the preservative solution and it must be kept clean in order to avoid suspended particles that will produce obstruction of the flow through the vessels of the bamboo culm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permanent and strict quality control of the process as well as of the treated bamboo products is mandatory,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sap-displacement preservation plant has been described before (Gonzalez and Gutierrez, 1996). Since then up to now, this process as well as the dip-diffusion method have been improved according to the description below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial sap-displacement pressure treatment plants. In the treatment plants being commercially used at FUNBAMBU, the rubber caps embracing the culm ends have been improved to simplify and speed the process. They allow a fast fixing of the culm to the cap with a tight joint that prevents leakage. It is possible to have twelve bamboo culms ready for treatment in only 8 minutes. On the other hand, the problem of the air remaining in the upper part of the cap during the preservation process and thus preventing the flow of the liquid in this part of the culm, was eliminated by a bleed valve (Gonzalez and Gutierrez, 1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though clean water is employed for the preservative solution, the liquid flow was decreasing with time. It was found that particles of soil and dust, picked up by the preservative solution during the process, were plugging the extreme end of the culm were the liquid was entering. To overcome this problem, two kinds of filters were installed. First, a coarse one made out of cheese cloth, to filter the mixture of solution and sap coming from the top end of the culm as well as from the reservoir, collecting the liquid from the bleed valves. The second is a fine in-line filter with a paper-filtering element, which is installed just before the entrance of the preservative solution to the manifold where the culms are connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure system was improved for a larger capacity with an eighty-liter pneumatic tank. With this tank more culms can be treated at once. At present, up to 100 culms can be treated simultaneously. With the tank larger capacity, the pressure can also be kept constant for longer periods. The pressure plant was further improved by placing corrugated galvanized iron roof sheets underneath the culms being treated, in order to collect the liquid spilling from the nodes. In this way, almost 100% of the preservative can be collected and recycled (Fig.4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dip-diffusion treatment plant. The dip-diffusion treatment plant was built to treat &quot;esterilla&quot; and &quot;reglilla&quot;. It consists of a tank made of four used steel oil barrels, which have been cut into halves and  welded to produce a tank of approximately 300-liter capacity (Fig. 5). A steel frame that allows for a proper height to facilitate the immersion of bamboo laths supports this tank. After a brief period of immersion, the laths are placed over corrugated iron roof sheets and left for a brief time to collect the excess liquid and return it into the tank. The laths are removed, wrapped with a plastic film and stacked for the preservative to diffuse into the material. Finally, the plastic is taken off and the material is placed in a well-ventilated covered place for drying. Since plastic sheets are expensive and do not last long, a permanent covered place has been projected that can be closed for the diffusion stage and opened later for drying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QUALITY CONTROL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be sure that the material is well treated, it becomes essential to strictly follow the different steps of the treatment process. First, the preservative solution has to be prepared. For this purpose, the required amount of preservative is weighted and the water is measured by volume and mixed in the working tank, according to the required concentration. After complete solution, when the liquid is clear, a sample of the liquid is taken into a cylinder where, with the help of a hydrometer and a thermometer, the specific gravity and the temperature of the solution are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of Figure 6, the concentration of the solution is read directly. For example: 1.068 specific gravity at 25° C gives 12 % Boron-salt concentration. The concentration is checked regularly and adjusted as needed by the addition of more preservative or more water until the required concentration is again reached. Afterwards, the culms are connected at their bottom to the rubber caps and the system is filled with the liquid preservative, bleeding each cap to ensure that all air is expelled out from the system. Next, each one of the inlet pressure liquid valves is opened and the treatment process starts. The sap will start dripping at the other end of the culms almost immediately. The complete replacement of the sap by the preservative may take from minutes to hours depending on the length and wall thickness of the culms and the amount of time elapsed since it was cut. For the usual pieces, 3 to 4 meters long, the average time is below 20 minutes. To check that the culms have reached the final point of treatment, a simple test with a pH sensitive paper is carried out. A change of color is observed because there is a relation between boron concentration and the pH of the liquid coming out of the culm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the culms have been treated they are stored and allowed to dry in a covered place to avoid direct exposure to excessive moisture from rain and heat and ultraviolet rays from the sun. The first effect may produce leaching of the preservative and subsequently fungi infestation and insect attack and the second, splitting and structural collapse of the cross section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drying in a very humid tropical climate takes a lot of time. It is therefore recommended to allow for enough space between the bamboo pieces and an adequate distance from the wet soil -not less than 40 cm- for good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;When the preservative has reached complete diffusion and the material is dry, a thin cross sectional sample of several representative culms is cut near &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;the extreme where the liquid emerged. This sample is further dried for three to five hours in a kiln, heated to a temperature of no more than 60° C. The sample is covered throughout with fine drops of a curcumin solution (Solution 1) and, 15 to 30 minutes later, with an acid solution (Solution 2). In ten minutes time a bright red color should develop, indicating that the culm has being well treated and contains a sufficient amount of boron. A yellow color indicates insufficient amounts of boron.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FINAL REMARKS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sap-replacement treatment of bamboo culms, as developed by the Costa Rican National Bamboo Project, is a well proven technology that has already being transferred to, among others, the Environmental Bamboo Foundation, Bali, Indonesia, since 1994 and to the &quot;Bamboo World&quot; Establishment of Victor Cusack, Australia (Cusack, 1997). The FUNBAMBU technical staff is willing to provide the complete technology transfer procedure upon request&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Protection of Bamboo Structures</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/protection-bamboo-structures</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bamboo culm is a unique building material for all kinds of structures. Most important are bamboo houses of different types, which provide worldwide homes for many millions of people, not only in rural areas, but also in urban environments. Its use as a substitute or alternative for wood is accelerated by the increasing shortage of timber in most bamboo producing countries. The application of bamboo is promoted by international activities, as presently by the Workshop on Bamboo Constructions, August, 2007,Cali, Colombia, the International Conference on Modern Bamboo Structures, October 2007 in Changsha, China, the 2007 International Workshop on Bamboo, November, Hangzhou, China and an International Bamboo Building Design Competition with 250 designs in 12 building categories , submitted from 25 countries. The wider acceptance of bamboo for structural uses, however, is often hindered by its liability to biological degradation. These hazards have their impact on restrictive building regulations for barn boo in several countries. The protection of barn boo structures against biological hazards is an important requirement for utilizing this valuable woody resource (Liese, Kumar 2003, Liese 2004). Compared with the protection of timber in tropical countries there are certain similarities, but also considerable differences (Willeitner, Liese 1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bamboo in Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To utilize bamboo for construction, it is important to consider the technological properties of the culm but also its low durability against organisms. In a suitable environment, the culms are easily attacked by fungi and beetles. In ground contact, bamboo structures are destroyed in less than two years, under cover after A-7 years, but may last for a long time in a favorable situation. Bamboo culms do not produce any toxic substances during their lifetime, unlike the heartwood of many trees, so that the whole culm can be destroyed. In addition, the culm contains about 50% parenchyma cells, filled with starch as stored energy, which is needed for the development of new culms. Since their growth starts generally after the rainy season, the starch content will then be lowest, resulting in a reduced liability to attack. An influence of culm cutting around the full moon on the durability has not been proven.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 class=&quot;element-invisible&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/file/15&quot;&gt;image002.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;image002&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;media-image alignright size-full wp-image-219 media-element file-media-large&quot; data-delta=&quot;1&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://necbdc.org.in/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image002.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non Chemical Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any utilization of bamboo, the possibilities of non-chemical methods should be considered first to avoid the danger of environmental pollution. The main principle should be reducing the high moisture content and avoiding any later uptake by rain or ground contact (Moran, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a traditional method clump curing has to be mentioned. CuIms are cut at the base and left leaning against neighbouring ones. The ongoing transpiration by the leaves reduces the moisture content and also the starch, thus enhancing some resistance against borers and staining fungi. For the common water- storage fresh culms are immersed in water for at least month, whereby the starch content is reduced mainly by bacterial action. The susceptibility to deteriorating fungi and termites is however hardly reduced. Another common method for protection without biocides is the plastering of bamboo mats with mud, clay or cement. Plastering is not only applied by villagers, but also for urban houses. The tight seal by mortar protects against moisture and prevents the entry of beetles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long standing tradition exists to protect bamboo structures by constructional methods, which prevent the access of moisture. The main advantage is that no chemicals with their possible environmental impact have to be applied. Well-known are base supports by stones, pre-formed concrete footings or even durable wood blocks as well as an overhanging roof. If the environment is unsuitable for beetles and fungi, impressive structures can be built, like in the Cordillera region of Colombia, where in an altitude above 1.5000 m termites do not exist. (Jayanetti, 1998, Janssen, 2002, Vantomme et al. 2003).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bamboo smoking system, originally applied in Japan by storing fresh culms above a fireplace has been developed in Colombia for commercial operation. A standing furnace is filled with semi-dry culms and heated by burning organic residues at around 55 C° for about two weeks until moisture is reduced to about 12%. For the impressive ZERI Pavilion at the EXPO 2000 in Hannover about 3.500 culms of 9 m length had been smoke-treated in Colombia. However, the technical parameters for this process have still be refined and long time results are wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For timber, a heat treatment has been developed in recent years with a wider practical application. Temperatures above 150 C° lead to a better dimensional stability and improved resistance against micro-organisms due to modification of organic matter. Trials with split bamboo at temperatures above 200 C° resulted in an enhanced durability against fungal attack, but the mechanical properties were severely reduced, as it has also been observed for timber (Leithoff, Peek, 2001).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 class=&quot;element-invisible&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/file/16&quot;&gt;image007.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;image007&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;media-image alignleft size-full wp-image-220 media-element file-media-large&quot; data-delta=&quot;2&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://necbdc.org.in/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image007.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection with Chemicals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases a chemical treatment is needed. A key factor is the sufficient preservation of the culm. However, its treatability is rather low. Unlike timber, the bamboo tissue is quite resistant towards penetration of liquids due to its anatomical structure (Liese 1998). The culm is covered at its outside by a water-tight layer, the cuticula, and inwards by a suberin layer, which hinders side-ways penetration by simple treatments. Radial pathways, like the rays in timber do not exist. The uptake of a preservative is therefore restricted mainly to the vessel,. at the culm ends. They run through the internodes like &quot;water- pipes &quot; and become partly modified at the nodal region. The total vessel volume amounts to only 6-8 %, in comparison to about 70 % of softwoods. The main tissue of around 90 % parenchyma and fibers has to be penetrated and protected by diffusion. The passing of the vessels can be hindered by tyloses and slime blocking (Liese.1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited access of the bamboo tissue through the vessels only reduces the possibility for treatment with monomers, which has been considered for quality improvement of bamboo (Lawniczczak 1991, 1993; Liese 1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As preservatives water-borne types are in use. They can penetrate by diffusion the tissue of moist culms 4or a complete protection. Boron compounds are most common for culms and products. Also CCA and CCB¬types are used in Asia and other bamboo regions, preferably by factories which normally treat timber. Creosote had been applied earlier, mainly in a marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For prophylactic protection of culms in storage insecticides are common as sprays. Fire retardants to cover the surface are hardly used. Natural toxicants are tried from several plants, like Neem, for the protection of bamboo handicrafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment methods for bamboo depend on the intended use, the type of material and the environmental aspects. Painting with industrial lacquers is applied for furniture and handicraft. Besides the coloring it may have some hydrophobic effect, but does not provide protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-pressure process the butt-end-treatment is common, whereby the base of fresh culms is immersed in a container. It is a simple process and used for the culm protection for supporting fruit trees or in vineyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soaking method is often applied. Fresh culms, preferable with broken nodal walls and/or borings in the internodes at opposite sides are submerged in a boron-containing solution for 7-10 days. Recently, the Vertical Soak and Diffusion Process (VDS) has been developed by the Environmental Bamboo Foundation ( EBF), Bali. Freshly harvested culms are vertically stacked in a basin and all nodal walls fractured, except the lowest one. The internodes are filled up with the preservative for about two weeks. Then the lower node is also ruptured and the solution released in the basin. By this method especially the inner, nutritious culm part is protected, whereby the culm skin is free from any preservative residues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special importance merits the classical sap- replacement method, which allows a complete penetration of a fresh culm by boric salts while providing a clean surface. Once developed in France for spruce stems by A. Boucherie, 1840, the method was modified for bamboo in India (Purushotham et al. 1954, Liese 1959), further improved and is now employed in many countries. The preservative is pushed from a closed container by a pressure pump into the base of the culm to withdraw the sap from the vessels, which flows off from the top end. Culms of 9 m length are treated within 30-50 minutes with a pressure of 1.9-1.3 bar. The sap-replacement method is a reliable and environmental friendly treatment for bamboo culms since the preservative is closed inside the culm (Liese et al. 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure treatment provides the best protection, but is hardly applied anymore, except for water-front structures. Creosote and CCA-salts are the main preservatives. Split bamboo and woven mats obtain a high absorption and which might be useful for special cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A remedial treatment of infested culms or construction parts is seldom to be recommended. It is quite uncertain to determine the extent of deterioration within the culm. Fumigation and bore-hole treatment are sometimes applied. If possible, the building component has to be replaced by a treated part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality control is an essential tool for any bamboo construction (Janssen 2001). For bamboo preservation it is even more demanding, albeit most neglected. It concerns the quality of the bamboo material to be treated, the choice, concentration and uptake of the preservative and a sufficient distribution within the culm tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and environmental risks are important aspects for bamboo preservation, but often neglected. Although regulations may exist at varying degrees, they are often not known or considered. Strict regulations have to be applied wherever bamboo is chemically treated. This should be permitted only at sites where the required skill, experience and control are available to avoid danger for the workers and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing and economics are key factors for a demand of treated material and essential for the economical success of the treatment installation. Most factories treat on demand only so that stock- keeping of treated material does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economics is the major component considered by the consumer for the choice of chemically treated bamboo. The wide-spread use of bamboo products is often based on minimal wages for the poorest and an easy replacement. The progress towards better living will raise simultaneously the cost for harvesting and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, excessive harvesting and the increasing demand of bamboo processing factories, like for pulp and parquet have led regionally to a shortage of bamboo. Also a displacement of bamboo by competitive materials, like plastic is to be observed. Nice looking walls and commodities from plastic are less expensive, durable, with no toxic effects and more colorful then the local ones from bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo protection against deterioration can contribute considerable to utilize this gift of nature efficiently for the welfare of the rural people and as a significant contribution to the biomass resource.&lt;/p&gt;
