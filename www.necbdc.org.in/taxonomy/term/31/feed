His single minded pursuit has brought in National and International focus to the traditional skills possessed by the crafts persons and artisans of the North Eastern Region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International awards he received from UNESCO are THE UNESCO CRAFTS PRIZE 2005 FOR THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION and UNESCO-CCI 2005 SEAL OF EXCELLENCE FOR HANDCRAFTED PRODUCTS IN SOUTH ASIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seal of excellence for handcrafted products in South Asia was won by him in the product category of Hand Fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mantu Chandra Das began his pursuit of craftsmanship at the tender age of ten under the tutelage of Shri Gauranga Das of Agartala. In his life long journey as a craftsman, he united his creative vision for bamboo with the skills acquired in the initial phase of his career. This resulted in the creation of exquisite bamboo products handcrafted by him which are expressions of his ingenuity. With his works and his guidance as a trainer in Bamboo &amp;amp; Cane Development Institute, he has inspired countless artisans to devote themselves to bamboo craftsmanship as a career. He has developed a vast range of prototypes, tools and designs which contributed immensely to the development of the bamboo handicrafts. For his contribution, particularly to the development of clusters as production centers for cane and bamboo handicrafts, he received the National Award in 1979. It is very difficult to summarize in few sentences, a lifetime of contribution of this Master Craftsman for the upliftment of the Cane and Bamboo Handicrafts.&lt;/p&gt;
