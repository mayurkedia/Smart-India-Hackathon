 <title>Achievements of National Bamboo Mission</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/achievements-national-bamboo-mission</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Till recently, bamboo has remained confined mostly to the forest (12.8% of forest area), two third of the growing stock being located in the North-Eastern States. Importance of the crop as a source of raw material for industrial and domestic use with its growing demand all over the country necessitated its cultivation in farm lands as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major focus was given in area expansion under bamboo crop and an area of 48475 ha has been covered both in forest and non-forest lands during the period 2008-10. A sizeable portion of the existing bamboo is old and senile, out of which, an area of 11609 ha has been rejuvenated during the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity building through training of farmers and field functionaries has been priority for the Mission. During the two years, 5054 farmers have been trained within the state, 1296 outside the state and 1079 field functionaries were trained under TOT. Bamboo Technical Support Groups (Dehradun, Peechi in Kerala and Guwahati) are supporting in training programmes for farmers and field functionaries in various aspects of bamboo like nursery management and plantation/cultivation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity of bamboo in the country before launch of National Bamboo Mission was as low as 3-4 tons /ha. To raise it to international level of about 20 tons /ha, systematic efforts involving use of quality planting material, establishing micro-irrigation and pest and disease management are being made. Having established 1164 Nurseries in preceding years, initiatives for pest and disease management were taken in 16440 ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Retail Outlet was established during 2009-10 to improve marketing infrastructure of products of bamboo in the country. Projects under Research and Development concentrate mainly on technology generation as appropriate to each region/state, keeping in view their specific agroclimatic and socio-economic conditions. Emphasis is given on effective documentation/transfer and dissemination of technologies available in India. Since inception, a total of 23 R&amp;amp;D projects have been sanctioned to various National/ State level institutions/State Agriculture Universities (SAUs), etc. which are under different stages&#039;of progress. The salient findings of these projects are as under:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clones of important species of bamboo collected and transplanted for evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum shoot production takes place during rainy season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo attained greater height (2.1 m) when grown in combination with other crops than as a sole crop (1.95 m) and the intercrops recorded higher growth and yield when grown in combination with bamboo than as a sole crop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhrizomatus cuttings treated with Indole Butyric Acid (IBA) led to maximum rooting in Dendrocalamus brandisii whereas the culm cuttings treated with IBA proved to maximum rooting in D. aspen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bambusetum with species available within and outside the state established.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drip irrigation in combination with 50 per cent recommended dose of fertilizers (Chemical + Organic) have been found most effective in Bamboo cultivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chlorpyriphos (0.05%) is found to be most effective remedy for control of bamboo leaf roller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;knowledge on bamboo, it was observed that no &lt;strong&gt;planned market system &lt;/strong&gt;exists in the countryside and prices vary significantly depending on its length and thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Introduction to Bamboo Housing - A concept from CBTC</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/introduction-bamboo-housing-concept-cbtc</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.necbdc.org.in/sites/default/files/article/Bamboo%20Housing.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is one of the strongest natural building materials known to man and is widely regarded as one of the most versatile grass or forest product. In countries of its natural distribution, apart from use as raw material for pulp and paper, its most extensive utilization is for construction purposes - as post, rafter, frame, partition, floor and roofing. Bamboo is not just an ideal wood substitute, it transcends wood. It comes pre-finished by nature as its culms can be used straight, without much processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many places, its use is restricted almost exclusively for low cost housing, built by the owners themselves. The usage of bamboo as a building material has many socio economic benefits. Bamboo has a good tolerance to earthquakes. Plus a village community can easily grow bamboo. A small plantation of just one hectare yields enough bamboo culms each year to repair the house and also to create some products which can be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bamboo growing country has a different kind &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;of traditional bamboo building and the available knowledge is without any system or coherence. Attempts are being made to document these indigenous technologies. As an economic building material, bamboo&#039;s rate of productivity and cycle of annual harvest outstrips any other naturally growing resource. If three or four bamboo culms are planted, then in four or five years mature clumps will emerge, and in eight years these will be mature enough to build a comfortable, low-cost house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Structural properties of Bamboo as a Building Material and in Comparison with other Building Materials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellulose in the bamboo acts as reinforcement similar to steel bars in reinforced concrete or glass fiber in fiber reinforced plastic. These fibers are concentrated nearthe outside. The stiffness (resistance against bending) that this distribution pattern creates is 10 per cent more than the one that a more even distribution pattern could offer (imagine a steel tube with high tensile steel on the outside and normal mild steel on the inside). The material between the dark spots is called &quot;parenchyma&quot; and it is the matrix in which the fibers are embedded (like the concrete between the steel bars). Approximately, a bamboo culm has 40 per cent fibers, 10 per cent vessels and 50 per cent parenchyma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The density of bamboo is 700-800 kg/m&#039; which vary with the type of bamboo. The greater the mass per volume, the denser is the material. The bending stress at failure is 0.14 times the mass per volume (in kg/m3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bamboo in comparison to steel, wood and aluminium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong and lightweight — can be used as a replacement for steel and aluminium for scaffolding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be laminated just like wood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structurally similar to steel, easy to work on and has compression properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been verified that, because of its hollowness, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;bamboo&#039;s effectiveness as a beam is better than a wooden beam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also costs less on a volume-to-volume basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mature bamboo culms can be harvested each year. In case of wood, one has to wait for some ten or twenty years, after which the area is cleared, with the risk of deforestation and erosion. In a bamboo plantation only the mature culms are removed, while the younger culms remain in &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;For a floor beam or a purlin the amount of bamboo required, is only 40 per cent of the timber needed for the same purpose. Bamboo is stronger than wood in shear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;In a structural application, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;bamboo poles are used to create  roof support systems.A typical rooof support system will have a truss and can be covered with a rafter and pulin network  for the roofting sheets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Bamboo - Structural Components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roof&lt;/strong&gt;: Corrugated bamboo roofing sheet is being developed at Indian Plywood Research and Training Institute) IPIRTI, Bangalore, India. It is made from woven bamboo mats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walls&lt;/strong&gt;: Woven bamboo mats are used to make walls in countries such as Bangladesh and India. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Vertical whole or halved culms and flattened tmboo strips are also used for making walls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;Walls can be made with bamboo as a minor component and mud as a major one (bahareque) as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doors and windows&lt;/strong&gt;: Bamboo can be fashioned artistically to make doors and windows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floors&lt;/strong&gt;: Floors can be made out of flattened bamboo, woven bamboo mats or split bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;The houses made by the National Bamboo project in Costa Rica are example of an good design; over hanging roof a structure of Bamboo  Culms, Walls of panels of split Bamboo with cement morter on both sides, and ventillation through the upper part of the walls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;t is a wattle and daub technique that normally uses timber poles for the walls  structural frames. A double layer of horizontal bamboo split is use as as supporting surface of the mortar, which is plastered on both the outer faces. This result in a very effective structural components.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;With the infusion of new techniques to create the various component of a structures,we  are now able to look ahead and suggest  the increasing use of Bamboo to create low cost housing ,Innovation Resort and Hotel structures prefabricated structures, pavilion etc. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;With proper treatment, good design practice and skill workman, it is possible to create standards in Bamboo construction  which will appeal to wider section of the society . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/cb-september-2010&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;B September 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Construction and Construction Methods</title>
 <link>http://www.necbdc.org.in/article/construction-and-construction-methods</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.necbdc.org.in/sites/default/files/article/Construction%20and%20Construction%20Methods2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; alt=&quot;Construction and Construction Methods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bamboo Building Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Plant the Hardest Species for the Climate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When growing bamboo species for building, choose varieties with thicker walls, as well as a cold tolerance that relates to your area - the key is to plant a species that is capable of withstanding the coldest seasonal temperatures. Refrain from using fertilizer on the bamboo, in particular nitrogen, which leads to rapid growth and weaker poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current international building code tested strength of a species from a single place and time as applicable for the entire species, regardless of growing conditions. Several builders have put forth the &quot;unproven&quot; idea that the density of the wood is a better measure of how soil, rainfall, care and age have all had their effect - regardless of species. Unfortunately, there are currently no grading or quality standards for bamboc poles. This means that the purchase of poles involves a great deal of faith and relationship-building between  buyer and grower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different species are chosen for import into the U.S because of a unique visual characteristic like striped leaves or colored culms. For builders, the moss intriguing species are seen by others as &quot;just another green bamboo.&quot; But imagine what we consider the holy grail of bamboos: in the tropical latitudes of the Himalayas, over thousands of years, plants have been forced to adapt to the rise of the mountains to very high elevations. So, the unique combination of a clumping, cold-tolerant, large diameter with strong fiber and tremendous pole production when grown in a more favorable climate might exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plant where there is Plenty of Water and Sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo requires plenty of water year round, as well as an abundance of sunshine. For this reason, bamboo is seen growing wild in ravines and along the banks of rivers and in places with a Monsoon hot-season climate: tropical Southeast Asia, the temperate foothills of the Himalayas, and the tropical northern half of South America primarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In places where there is less rain (i.e. southern California), wastewater is a good water source. The dense feeder roots make great filters and bamboo is capable of handling and using much hotter sources of nitrogen than most plants. Moso bamboo, for example, seems not to thrive unless watered every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;hen growing bamboo in places without monsoon rains, liberal use of mulch and cardboard will both hold in the moisture and allow the plant to use less energy otherwise needed to force its roots through the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;heavy clay soil. Additionally, oxygen enters through the rhizomes of the bamboo; therefore it is important that the plant is able to drain well. Mulch will allow for this process to happen efficiently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of sun required varies by species and past experience is catalogued by the American Bamboo Society. It is important to know that some bamboo species are native understory plants and need to be established in partial to full shade. In general, though, growth rates are significantly faster in full sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harvest Mature Poles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo reaches maturity three to six years after the shoot first emerges. At this point the fibers are strongest and there is less moisture in the culm. The beauty of planting your own bamboo is that you will know the age of your culms, and therefore when it is time to harvest. Unfortunately this is often not the case, but there are a few tell-tale signs to look for in order to determine whether or not a culm is ready to be harvested. In tropical climates, the oldest culms &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;are the ones with the most lichen and mosses. Clean smooth poles should be avoided as they are probabl new shoots and are lacking the strong structura qualities needed for building. Some species (i.e Genus Phyllostachys) have a characteristic white wa&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt; ring below the nodes that will gradually darken over time. Once it is no longer &quot;white,&quot; the pole is in its third year. Other species acquire color slowly over time for example Phyllostachys nigra and PhyllostachyE nigra &quot;bory&quot; acquire their dark spots over several years. Also in the Phyllostachys genus, plants grow another sub-branch on the same lateral branch each year - therefore the age of the culm can be found by counting the branchlets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harvest When the Sugar Content is Lowest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best to harvest bamboo when the starch content of the plant is lower and therefore less susceptible to attacks by insects (though some argue that this is due to seasonal changes in insect populations and not the starch content of the plant). There is rich regional folklore and traditions that describe the optimal bamboo harvesting day and time. In Colombia, for example, it is widely believed that bamboo needs to be felled during the waning moon, just before sunrise. In parts of India, bamboo that is cut during the bright, new moon is believed to be less susceptible to insect attacks. The important point is to harvest when sugar is at a minimum: after the spring and fall growth spurts, and following the rainy season can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When felling the culms, cut at the base, &quot;over the first node located above the ground&quot;, using as narrow a cutting tool as possible to reach between culmn. A battery-powered Sawzall, chain saw, machete, pointed handsaw or a hatchet are all effective. make sure that a bowl isn&#039;t formed by rain water and rot the rhizome. While bamboo is relatively resistant to pests, the reason for the concern about sugars is related to attacks by powder post&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt; beetles, dinoderus minutus. Termites are generally uninterested, and other insects see the bamboc more as a home than food, the beetles will drill their 1/8&quot; diameter holes and eat until very little structurE remains. The damage might not be obvious since thE beetles tunnel back and forth within the fibers and only visibly emerge when they&#039;re done - at which point thE thin-walled poles can be crushed with your bare hand The advantage of choosing the thicker walled poles is that the edible portion is the pithy interior fiber, not thE structural exterior material. In this case, the pole wil retain its structural qualities after an insect attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Less-Toxic Treatment Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways that treating bamboo extends the life of the pole: it makes it distasteful to insects anc it changes the pH and keep the moisture levels low to keep out fungus. When thinking about treatment methods, consider how framing lumber is treated in your area, and do the same. Since Douglas Fir is never used exposed to weather, then keep bamboo inside in order to achieve maximum longevity. In general, untreated bamboo poles have a life of 1-2 years when exposed to the elements, 3-5 years when sheltered from rain, and up to hundreds of years when used indoors. The current less toxic treatment salts remain water soluble, but the task of treatment is to get it into the interior fibers, so it can, in theory, be exposed to the rain for awhile... it&#039;s just not great practice. In particular, do not expose the interior of bamboo to the outdoors. If bamboo is split open to reveal the interior, the sugar will cause little black dots of mildew to appear as soon as the rain starts. Surprisingly, one of the most effective treatments combines the ingredients found in eyewash and laundry soap. Boric acid -- found in Visine and Dr. Pepper, and most inexpensively sold as a fertilizer or mouse poison -- has little ill effect on mammals. Combine in equal parts with borax (sold as Twenty Mule Team laundry detergent) is not good for plants, but at about the 5% concentration that won&#039;t dissolve further, it is effective &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;against both fungi and powder-post beetles. In Bali, the vertical soak diffusion method is used where the borax mixture is poured into the pole which has had the nodes punched out, leaving only the last one. The mixture is left in the pole for nearly a week where it diffuses through the pithier interior cell walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another treatment method is the Boucherie system: a form of pressure injection that must be done within 24 hours of harvest or the capillaries close. This one can be a challenge. Various experiments have been done using smoke, but with mixed reviews. Japanese companies have perfected the method but the specific details have not reached other countries. At the moment, there are good things to say about hydrogen peroxide (but it&#039;s relatively expensive) and various plant-based traditional treatments practiced locally and worthy of intense study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work with the Bamboo once shrinkage has taken place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to work with fresh, green bamboo if adjustable joinery (a system that can be tightened over time as the poles shrink) is used, but it is recommended &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;to work with dry bamboo. After harvesting the bamboo, leave the culm in the grove - upright, propped up off the ground and with the branches and leaves still attached   - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt; for a few weeks. It will continue to photosynthesize and use up the remaining sugar in the culm until the plant runs out of water. The powder-post beetles are unlikely to enter the culm during this time because they enter through the cuts (i.e. where the branch is cut off).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moisture content varies greatly between culms (as well as between sections of the same culm) and as the bamboo dries it will shrink about 6-10% in diameter, but almost not at all along the length. A general indicator is that once the green color is gone - which might be between 6 weeks and 6 months - it may be checked to see if it is in the desired 10-15% moisture content. Air-dry the bamboo by storing it in a covered area, out of the sun, preferably vertical for good air circulation and to keep it from becoming more curved months or so after harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan on Splitting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to bamboo splitting, do not ask &quot;whether,&quot; ask &quot;when.&quot; The bamboo you are working with will split, the key is to be prepared for this and know what to do when it happens. Outside of a few species of guadua, the fiber structure of bamboo runs in one direction, the length of the pole. The only exception is at the node where the fiber turns and runs perpendicular to the exterior to fill in the middle of the pole. Unfortunately, when the pole dries, the shrinkage of about 6-10% is entirely across the grain and the node shrinks differentially from the rest of the pole, causing the pole to split. This is especially true when a heat source, like the sun, hits the pole on just one side. Fence builders in Japan have learned that completely punching out the nodes can often prevent splitting. The stress can also be relieved by making a pre-emptive cut on the bandsaw the length of the pole, then gluing it back together (just as with a curly piece of wood). Joinery that wraps all of the way around the pole can also contribute to holding the pole together. Using banding or fiber binding at crucial joints will keep the fibers together, even if it never splits. With hollow bamboos, using something &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;as simple as a radiator hose clamp can hold the fibers together. Joints can also be wrapped with twine for a different aesthetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right bamboo specie for the job is extremely important. Some of the solid bamboos are much less prone to splitting: Phyllostachys heteroclada &#039;solid stem,&#039; Dendrocalamus strictus, Otatea acuminate &#039;aztecorum&#039;, and several of the Chusquea genus. Of the hollow bamboos, those of the Guadua genus are generally thicker walled and have more of a helical fiber pattern. The lower portion of the culms especially will accept a nail or screw without a pilot hole, a characteristic not found in any other bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&#039;t let the Bamboo touch Soil or Concrete&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of climate, a main objective of bamboo design is to prevent the wicking of moisture on the ground up into the bamboo. Building codes generally require eight inches between wood and soil, and at least several inches between wood and exterior concrete. The other simultaneous need in a post is to prevent it from pulling out of the ground. A good joint puts a separator like metal between the bamboo and the foundation, while at the same time holds onto that metal vigorously. The simplest way to achieve this is to make a bridge between the cellulose (bamboo) and the damaging water (in the ground or concrete). For &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;example, use a piece of steel rebar or angle iron cast into the footing and mortar it several nodes into the bamboo to prevent withdrawal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give the Building a &quot;Good Hat and Boots&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undoubtedly the most important lesson and one that is often overlooked. The first choice is to use all bamboo inside the structures. This will keep the sun and rain from affecting your building. Even small rafter tails peeking out beyond the overhang are guaranteed to split and provide insect habitat in a couple of years. In the United States, millions of board feet of our favorite framing lumber - Douglas fir - are used, but almost none on the exterior where it would quickly rot. The first thing that happens is the sun and rain dissolve the protective wax, the surface bleaches to silver, the heat from the sun on only one side of the pole causes it to expand unevenly then split, and the fibers become brittle and break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Achieve Shear Strength with Triangles in your Truss Design or with Shear Walls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use bamboo in tension and compression, not bending (imagine the flexing of a pole). It is important to &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;recognize that bamboo wants to bend, but it is put to best use in pure tension or compression. Structural design principles for bamboo structures are the same as any other building system: for longer spans, design trusses. This will keep the poles from acting in bending. When designing, do not ask for the same curve in multiple poles. Tight curves especially will be more of a fight than you want. Recognize the ever-present curvature. Most bamboos naturally curve in two dimensions not three, in a direction that is related to the branches. Poles can be turned until the flat is found in order to put multiple poles in the same plane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build With Triangles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing a building with a series of triangles will provide stability by making the entire structure rigid. No shear walls will be required to carry the horizontal forces down to the ground. On the other hand, to rely on the strength of the joinery to this degree means that joinery should be optimized as much as possible. Additionally, longer spans have two or three bamboos stacked in the structural equivalent of a glu-laminated wood beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use bolted and filled joinery systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where planning ahead helps the most. If you plan a structure that is quick to assemble and relies  on&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt; simple joinery that is hundreds of times stronger than traditional lashed or pinned joints, then a relatively small investment in hardware makes perfect sense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In western cultures, we think of our favorite building materials, especially wood, as subtractive. We start with a large piece and keep making it smaller until it is right. The surface is usually made flat and of standardized shape. With bamboo, the thinking is more akin to masonry, with the shape predetermined and not easily changed. The key is to celebrate the difference and use bamboo where the shape is an asset and very visible in the finished surfaces. Design the structure in order to avoid time-consuming joinery, especially where materials must be coped and curved &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;in order to meet the bamboo. This will allow more effort to be put into smart design rather than into laborious repetition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceived by Simon Velez and Marcelo Villegas, the mortar-filled joint is a recent development in the history of bamboo buildings, and one that has made the largest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
